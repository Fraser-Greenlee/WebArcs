-------
plan

add a hidden column to hub to stop their posts from being shown to anyone

add an admin form for adding sites

add a system for adding rss feeds with a default as hidden

? with each link that links to a seperate feed add a subscribe prompt after viewing

? make programme to get top sites from different aggregate sites
