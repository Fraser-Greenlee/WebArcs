		<description><![CDATA[Brexit's downsides are clear; might tech help realize upsides in building something new based on a new world order?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The TV upfronts that I <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/tv-advertisings-surprising-strength-and-inevitable-fall/">wrote about last week</a> may seem like an odd entry point to discuss Brexit and its relationship to technology, but the core insight in that piece is critical. From <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/a-word-on-tesla-follow-up-the-big-picture-tencent-acquires-supercell/">my follow-up in The Daily Update</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  While it is fine and useful to look at industries like TV or transportation or consumer packaged goods or retail in isolation, if you step back far enough all of these industries are interconnected and symbiotic. TV and our modern transportation system and big consumer packaged goods conglomerates and brick-and-mortar retail all came of age in the post World War II era, and all were built with the same assumptions like the importance of scale, controlling distribution, and crucially, that each other existed. There were positive feedback loops driving the growth of all of them together (and many other industries as well).
</p></blockquote>
<p>The implication of this symbiosis is that just as these different industries rose together, they will assuredly fall together as well, and indeed that is slowly but surely happening for all the reasons I detailed last week. For now, though, leave these particulars to the side; I&#8217;ll return to them later.</p>
<p>The key takeaway, and my starting point, is the realization that no single issue or company or industry or country stands alone: everything operates in systems, and both influences and is influenced by the system within which it operates. By extension, any change to one part of the system must impact and change other parts of the system: the greater the change, the greater the upheaval until the system can return to equilibrium. Sometimes, though, the change destroys the system completely.</p>
<h4>The Old System</h4>
<p>During the 20th century, particularly the post World War II era, the United States led the formation of a multinational system that balanced the government, large corporations, and labor.</p>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/stratechery-Year-One-283.png"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/stratechery-Year-One-283-1024x768.png" alt="stratechery Year One - 283" width="640" height="480" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2202" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/stratechery-Year-One-283-1024x768.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/stratechery-Year-One-283-300x225.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/stratechery-Year-One-283-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>The U.S. focused its foreign policy on the interrelated goals of containing communism, preventing inter-European wars, and creating markets for the massive industries that had sprung up during World War II and now needed to accommodate millions of returning soldiers. In Europe the headlining effort was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_plan">Marshall Plan</a> that combined aid used primarily to buy American-produced goods with an insistence on reducing trade barriers; the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade came a year later. The Marshall Plan was administered by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_for_European_Economic_Cooperation">Organisation for European Economic Co-operation</a>, one of the first pan-European bodies that started the continent on the long road to the European Union (a road that was paved with U.S. government money<sup><a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-brexit-possibility/#footnote_0_2200" id="identifier_0_2200" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The CIA financed nearly all the various organizations and individuals pushing for political integration">1</a></sup>). This dual mission of peace through bureaucracy paid for with trade has endured.</p>
<p>For their part, increasingly massive corporations built out the U.S.&#8217;s military power, manufactured most of the industrial and agricultural equipment on which Marshall Plan money was spent, and produced all of the accoutrements of a booming middle class: said middle class worked at those massive corporations, building everything from tanks to cars to washing machines, and spending their money on the same.</p>
<p>The implicit deal was this: the government created markets for the corporations, who in turn provided not just employment but also security for their employees, funding health insurance and pensions, while employees (and corporations) paid for the government: in 1960 the lowest income bracket paid 20%, while the highest paid 90%, and the corporate tax rate was 52%. Europe followed a similar model, but spared of the burden of a huge military, nationalized most social security programs, especially health care but also pensions. And, for two decades, the systems were in equilibria.</p>
<h4>How Globalization Upended the System</h4>
<p>Globalization is by no means a recent phenomena: the idea of trading goods with other groups, so as to realize the benefits of comparative advantage<sup><a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-brexit-possibility/#footnote_1_2200" id="identifier_1_2200" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Comparative advantage is the idea that collective productivity can be maximized if every person/group/country specializes in what they are best at, and then trade for what else they need, as opposed to every person/group/country being entirely self-sufficient. This is one of the most important factors underlying economic progress; to take a very fundamental example, few of us grow our own food, as it is more efficient for farmers to do that at scale. We, in turn, sell our specialization to others giving us the means to buy food.">2</a></sup> dates back to the earliest recorded human civilizations in the third millennium B.C.E. More pertinent to this discussion, the combination of the industrial revolution (which supercharged the idea of specialization) and steamships massively increased trade in the 19th century, where the freedom of movement of goods was primarily guaranteed by colonialism: colonies supplied the raw materials and bought the finished goods, giving colonial powers massive trade surpluses that could be used to fight intermittent wars with each other.</p>
<p>This system was utterly destroyed by two World Wars, resulting in the U.S.-dominated system above; still, though, the flow of goods was similar: the U.S., the world&#8217;s new superpower, was a net exporter, even as Europe and Japan in particular built up their own industrial base first with U.S. funds, and then by selling goods both to the U.S. and to each other. The deal was intact.</p>
<p>Then, in the years leading up to the 1970s, three technological advances completely transformed the meaning of globalization:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1963 Boeing produced the 707-320B, the first jet airliner capable of non-stop service from the continental United States to Asia; in 1970 the 747 made this routine</li>
<li>In 1964 the first transpacific telephone cable between the United States and Japan was completed; over the next several years it would be extended throughout Asia</li>
<li>In 1968 ISO 668 standardized shipping containers, dramatically increasing the efficiency with which goods could be shipped over the ocean in particular</li>
</ul>
<p>These three factors in combination, for the first time, enabled a new kind of trade. Instead of manufacturing products in the United States (or Europe or Japan or anywhere else) and trading them to other countries, multinational corporations could invert themselves: design products in their home markets, then communicate those designs to factories in other countries, and ship finished products back to their domestic market. And, thanks to the dramatically lower wages in Asia (supercharged by China&#8217;s opening in 1978), it was immensely profitable to do just that.</p>
<p>It is difficult to overstate the positive impact of this particular period of globalization. Billions of people were lifted out of abject poverty, especially in China but also throughout Asia, and the United States and other western countries became significantly richer as well; trade is absolutely a win-win. Critically, though, while everyone benefited from cheaper goods, the profits were not shared equally: the managers of multinational corporations and their owners reaped the vast majority of the benefits, even as their employee base effectively shifted from their domestic markets to Asia.</p>
<p>This undid the post-World War II deal: middle class jobs began to disappear, and along with them the economic and social security that had been provided by corporations. It took time, to be sure, but the ascension of China to the WTO in 2001 dramatically accelerated this shift, and while its full effects were hidden by a massive expansion in credit fueled by a housing bubble, once that came crashing down in 2008 the former middle classes of developed countries came to realize just how deep was the hole they fell into.</p>
<h4>The Inevitable Fallout</h4>
<p>Remember, everything is a system. And, given the changes wrought by the post 1970s wave of globalization, it is foolish to think that a core component of society — labor — can be fundamentally changed without there being knock-on effects on the other components of that system. The first murmurs were the 2009 rise of the Tea Party on the right, and the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement on the left. While the participants of the two groups couldn&#8217;t be more different — indeed, they loathe each other — both were outraged at &#8220;the System&#8221;.</p>
<p>Both movements have flowered this election cycle, both in the United States and the United Kingdom: an old-school leftist was elected the leader of the U.K.&#8217;s Labour Party, and another nearly nominated by the Democratic Party. On the right the Republican Party has nominated Donald Trump, aided in no small part by the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-voters-decide/">dramatic weakening of media institutions</a>, while the U.K., in a campaign led by Conservative Party insurgents and the far-right U.K. Independence party, has just voted to leave the European Union with the support of many traditional Labour voters. In both cases there is a new cleavage: less right versus left, and more elites who have benefited from globalization and a middle class that has been left behind.</p>
<p>Again, there are clear differences between the left and right: the former sees Wall Street or The City as the villain, while the latter blames immigration. Both, though, in their own way, want a return to the old deal: honest work for an honest wage, and an increasing sense of having nothing-to-lose until it happens.<sup><a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-brexit-possibility/#footnote_2_2200" id="identifier_2_2200" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Is there a racial component to the opposition to immigration? Almost certainly. But I suspect the ugly manifestations of whatever darkness lies in people&rsquo;s hearts would be much less common in a thriving economy">3</a></sup></p>
<h4>Tech and A New System</h4>
<p>A return to the old deal won&#8217;t happen, of course, nor should we want it to: the last thirty years have made both the world generally and developed countries in particular richer than ever. What is needed, though, is a new system, and here the tech industry has a critical role to play.</p>
<p>While the first twenty years of the modern tech industry (starting with the personal computer) primarily benefited corporations, the last fifteen years have dramatically improved the quality of life for consumers. The defining quality of technology, particular Internet-based companies, has been the generation of massive amounts of consumer surplus. How much is it worth to have access to all of the world&#8217;s information in the palm of your hand, or to be connected with friends and family wherever they are, or to make new connections with people you have never met? Far, far more than however much one pays for a smartphone and a data plan.</p>
<p>That this largesse is financially viable for tech companies is a testament to their tremendous scale. While the old order was about multinationals, Google and Facebook and the rest are supranational: their addressable market is the world.<sup><a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-brexit-possibility/#footnote_3_2200" id="identifier_3_2200" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Except China, thanks to the Great Firewall">4</a></sup> Moreover, consumers&#8217; benefit is incumbents&#8217; pain: as I detailed above the new world order is slowly but surely drowning the old one. The question is just how transformative will that new world order be?</p>
<p>If the old system was defined by the government, big corporations, and labor, the new system should be about government, technology, and individuals. It looks something like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/stratechery-Year-One-284.png"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/stratechery-Year-One-284-1024x768.png" alt="stratechery Year One - 284" width="640" height="480" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2201" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/stratechery-Year-One-284-1024x768.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/stratechery-Year-One-284-300x225.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/stratechery-Year-One-284-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Government</strong></p>
<p>The first implication of the supranational nature of technology is that unlike the old multinationals, there is no need for government support to open markets and guarantee trade; for the most part, the less government involvement the greater maximization there will be of the consumer surplus that is already being generated. Rather, it is the government that ought take a much more active role in supporting individuals.</p>
<p>At the most basic level this should include security: while universal health care would be ideal, for lots of reasons both practical and political it may not be viable in the U.S. Given that, Obamacare is a huge step in the right direction; other developed countries like the U.K. are obviously well ahead here.</p>
<p>Second, instead of trying to recreate a 1950s fantasy of employment for life on an assembly line, the goal should be to create a far more dynamic labor market with a defined floor and significantly greater upside than the old system:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, a universal basic income, facilitated by the government, should be set at the lower bounds of what is necessary to escape poverty. Globalization may have been the first shoe to fall on the middle class, but automation is the other, and it will affect just as many jobs as manufacturing, including — especially — white collar ones</li>
<li>Second, the government should be loosening regulations on the &#8220;gig&#8221; economy: technology has dramatically increased the degree to which work can be segmented, and that&#8217;s a good thing. Moreover, these sorts of jobs provide the upside to a universal basic income&#8217;s floor: our goal should be to make it vastly easier for individuals to better themselves if they choose to do so (while the basic income provide protection against the gig economy&#8217;s inherent uncertainty)</li>
<li>Third, there should be a significant loosening of the regulations and taxation around business creation. One of the many benefits of technology and the Internet has been to make all kinds of new businesses far more viable than ever before, but it is far too hard to get started, and the bookkeeping requirements are far too onerous. This sort of loosening, combined with the reduction in risk resulting from a better safety net and basic income, plus the possibility of building working capital through gigs, could lead to an explosion in creativity and entrepreneurial activity</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these factors is critical: a universal basic income alone offers some degree of financial security, but it does not offer dignity to the recipient, or any return for society beyond a reduction in guilt. What is most important, and what offers the highest return, is enabling more and better ways to work and ultimately create: that requires fewer regulations and simpler taxation.</p>
<p><strong>Individuals</strong></p>
<p>I purposely changed the name of this part of the system from &#8220;labor&#8221; to &#8220;individuals&#8221;. While collective action was absolutely appropriate in a world where employment was dominated by massive corporations, collectiveness and the work it was appropriate for has its costs: a ceiling on the individual, both in terms of income and also creativity.</p>
<p>What makes today&#8217;s world so different than the 1950s are the means with which ambition and creativity can be realized. I can write a newsletter without owning a printing press; someone else can create jewelry without a physical storefront; another can make music without a recording studio, and distribute it without a record label. Those are the easy examples — who knows what sorts of products and services might result from an emboldened and secure middle class?</p>
<p>Young people in particular should relish this new world of opportunities: yes, the world of your parents is gone, but it does not automatically follow that the alternative is worse. Even with today&#8217;s mess there are far more entrepreneurial opportunities than ever before, and the younger one is the more one can accept the unnecessary risks that unfortunately still exist. And, on the flipside, opportunities predicated on the old system are themselves riskier than they have ever been.</p>
<p><strong>Tech</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s understandable why so many in tech are dismissive of the old order: beyond the consumer surplus being generated, and the systematic destruction of incumbents, the industry is increasingly the primary economic driver of the United States in particular, which offers a certain sense of invincibility. It would be against the self-interest of both consumers and politicians to hold tech back.</p>
<p>And yet, there is an aspect of that calculation not far removed from measuring computers based on speeds and feeds. Yes, any rational calculation about the impact of the tech industry shows how indispensable it is, but people are not always rational, especially when they are desperate. It is absolutely in the industry&#8217;s best interests to not only participate in but lead the creation of a new system that works to the benefit of all.</p>
<p>To that end, technology executives and venture capitalists should lead the campaign for the type of reforms I have listed above. More importantly, they should match their rhetoric with actions: companies like <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-05-20/apple-s-offshore-entities-avoid-taxes-senate-probe-finds">Apple</a> and <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/google-tax-avoidance-doesnt-know-what-he-gets-paid-salary-matt-brittin-hmrc-a6866991.html">Google</a> should strive to be technology leaders, not tax avoidance ones. Successful entrepreneurs and their investors should champion increased capital gains taxes with a bias towards much longer-term investment: this both encourages the long view even as it accounts for the massive return that comes to investors and shareholders in a winner-take-all world. VCs in particular should be willing to close the carried interest loophole, and everyone in the industry should be willing to shoulder higher tax rates.</p>
<p>The payoff is equilibrium: the chance to build fabulously successful businesses that go with the current, not against it. The alternative is far worse: once automation arrives, guess who is going to be the scapegoat?</p>
<h4>Brexit: Wrong Reasons, Right Results?</h4>
<p>To be clear, this is a package deal: higher tax rates to fuel a misguided attempt to recreate the 1950s would be just as much of a disaster as undoing the old deal has been for the middle class. The world has changed.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is why I’m not quite prepared to join in the panic over Brexit, although I understand and acknowledge the very real downsides. I keep coming back to the fact that the European Union is a product of the old order — a world where government entities existed to enable trade for multinationals and rules for everyone else. Small wonder the EU has been the most hostile to the changes wrought by tech! There is no question that undoing 40+ years of integration will be extremely painful — if indeed the U.K. <a href="http://app.ft.com/cms/s/c0669434-3c73-11e6-8716-a4a71e8140b0.html">leaves the EU at all</a> — but given that the old order has already been disrupted, how much is to be gained by continuing to pretend that nothing has changed? Alternatively, might there be potential in building something new?</p>
<p>To be sure, there is no evidence that Brexit was driven by a vision of a new world order; quite the opposite in fact. And, unlike many Brexit voters, I am mindful of the elite consensus about the problems with a withdrawal: trade still matters, and the loss of access to the European market, plus the internal side effects with regards to Scotland and Northern Ireland, are huge problems (and I can read a stock ticker!). But then again, the very definition of who is elite, and why, is as much a part of the system as anything else, and the fact there are so few voices even acknowledging the increased restrictiveness of the EU, or its complete lack of economic growth, much less grappling with why it is the EU came to be and how deeply entwined that is with the old system,<sup><a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-brexit-possibility/#footnote_4_2200" id="identifier_4_2200" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Above and beyond a desire to keep the peace, which is deeply meaningful">5</a></sup> is to my mind a missed opportunity to at least think about how things could be different.</p>
<p>Everything is connected, everything is a system — and a crisis is a terrible thing to waste.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[TV advertising is having a good week at the upfronts, and it may be more resilient than expected. That, though, means the crash will be even more abrupt.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a good few months for TV executives, who are in the middle of upfront negotiations with advertisers for the 2016-2017 television season. <a href="http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/2016-tv-upfront-advertising-rate-hikes-steve-burke-1201797919/">Variety reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  After several years of moving money out of TV ad budgets to experiment with new digital outlets and social media, several big advertisers are spending more on the boob tube – and the result, according to ad buyers and other executives familiar with the pace of this year’s “upfront” negotiations, are a series of rate increases that TV has not won since the end of the last U.S. recession.</p>
<p>  “It’s all about money coming back into the marketplace,” said one media buying executive, noting that consumer packaged goods companies, quick-service restaurant chains and pharmaceutical companies are moving money into TV’s annual upfront market, when the nation’s big media companies try to sell the bulk of their ad inventory for the coming programming cycle. Some of the money is coming back from digital spending, and some of it is being moved from TV’s so-called “scatter” market, when advertisers pay for commercials much closer to their air date.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Reports indicate those rate increases are running <a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/278445/broadcast-tv-upfront-begins-commands-some-strong.html">between 7% and 12%</a>, and follow on a 2015-2016 season that saw scatter advertising — advertising purchased closer to the airing date — <a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/television/cable-tv-and-digital-advertising-jumped-may-heading-upfronts-172117">up 16% year-over-year</a>. Apparently all that digital advertising hype was just a fad, right?</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be so sure.</p>
<h4>Advertising and Attention</h4>
<p>Despite all of the upheaval caused by the Internet, there are two truths about advertising that have remained constant:</p>
<ol>
<li>Advertising&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-03-03/advertisings-century-of-flat-line-growth">share of GDP has remained consistent</a> for 100 years<sup><a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/tv-advertisings-surprising-strength-and-inevitable-fall/#footnote_0_2191" id="identifier_0_2191" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Although this may be slowing; more on this tomorrow">1</a></sup></li>
<li>TV&#8217;s share of advertising, after growing for 40 years, has also remained consistent at just over 40% for the last 20 years</li>
</ol>
<p>Those twenty years have seen the emergence of digital advertising generally, and, over the last five years, mobile advertising: while this emergence is likely responsible for the halt in growth for TV, the real victims have been radio, magazines, and especially newspapers, which have shrunk from a nearly 40% advertising share to about 10%.</p>
<p>Still, digital and mobile&#8217;s 33% share of advertising falls well short of the amount of attention attracted. <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Growth-of-Time-Spent-on-Mobile-Devices-Slows/1013072">Digital accounted for</a> 47% of time spent with media in 2015, up from 32% in 2011, while TV has fallen from 41% in 2011 to 35% in 2015.<sup><a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/tv-advertisings-surprising-strength-and-inevitable-fall/#footnote_1_2191" id="identifier_1_2191" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Note that the advertising-free Netflix is categorized as digital; although the streaming service still serves a minority of U.S. households, its subscribers watch an average of 1 hour and 33 minutes a day, and are responsible for a good deal of TV&rsquo;s fall-off.">2</a></sup> This decline, though, is not evenly distributed: this jarring chart <a href="http://redef.com/original/after-tv-videos-future-will-be-bigger-more-diverse-precarious-than-its-past">from Redef</a> about the change in hours spent watching TV by age group shows that the situation for TV is much worse than the top-line numbers suggest:</p>
<p><a href="http://redef.com/original/after-tv-videos-future-will-be-bigger-more-diverse-precarious-than-its-past"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/REDEF_Feeds_v1.2-1024x574.png" alt="REDEF_Feeds_v1.2" width="640" height="359" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2192" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/REDEF_Feeds_v1.2-1024x574.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/REDEF_Feeds_v1.2-300x168.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/REDEF_Feeds_v1.2-768x431.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/REDEF_Feeds_v1.2.png 1450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>The three age groups with the biggest declines — millennials, basically — are the most attractive to the brand advertisers that dominate TV advertising: for one, the younger you are the less likely you are to have developed affinity for a particular brand, and for another, the younger you are the more years a brand has to earn back the money spent building said affinity. Small wonder brands have been so eager to jump on new digital platforms where said millennials are actually spending their time.</p>
<p>So why is money suddenly flowing back to TV?</p>
<h4>The Relationship Between TV and Advertisers</h4>
<p>The most obvious reason for TV&#8217;s enduring appeal to advertisers is that it is a pretty fantastic advertising medium: relaxed viewers, immersive experience, etc. The appeal, though, goes deeper: the very institution of television advertising is intertwined with the kinds of advertisers that use it the most, the products they sell, and the way they are bought-and-sold. And what should be terrifying to television executives is that all of those pieces that make television advertising the gold mine that it has been are under the exact same threat that TV watching itself is: the threat of the Internet.</p>
<p>Start with the top 25 advertisers in the U.S. The list is made up of:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 telecom companies (AT&amp;T, Comcast, Verizon, Softbank/Sprint)</li>
<li>4 automobile companies (General Motors, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, Toyota)</li>
<li>4 credit card companies (America Express, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Capital One)</li>
<li>3 consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies (Procter &amp; Gamble, L&#8217;Oréal, Johnson &amp; Johnson)</li>
<li>3 entertainment companies (Disney, Time Warner, 21st Century Fox)</li>
<li>3 retailers (Walmart, Target, Macy&#8217;s)</li>
<li>1 from electronics (Samsung), pharmaceuticals (Pfizer), and beer (Anheuser-Busch InBev)</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that the vast majority of the industries on on this list are dominated by massive companies that compete on scale and distribution. CPG is the perfect example: building a &#8220;house of brands&#8221; allows a company like Procter &amp; Gamble to target demographic groups even as they leverage scale to invest in R&amp;D, bring down the cost of products, and most importantly, dominate the distribution channel (i.e. retail shelf space). Said retailers, meanwhile, are huge in their own right, not only so they can match their massive suppliers at the bargaining table but also so they can scale logistics, inventory management, store development, etc. Automobile companies, meanwhile, are not unlike CPG companies: they operate a &#8220;house of brands&#8221; to serve different demographics while benefitting from scale in production and distribution; the primary difference is that they make money through one large purchase instead of over many smaller purchases over time.</p>
<p>Similar principles apply to the other companies on this list: all are looking to reach as many consumers as possible with blunt targeting at best, all benefit from scale, and all are looking to earn significant lifetime value from consumers. And, along those lines, all can afford the expense of TV. In fact, the <a href="http://www.warc.com/LatestNews/News/EmailNews.news?ID=35035">top 200 advertisers in the U.S.</a> love TV so much that they make up 80% of television advertising, despite accounting for only 51% of total advertising (and 41% of digital).</p>
<p>Note, though, that many of the companies on this list are threatened by the Internet:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPG companies are threatened on two fronts: on the high end the combination of e-commerce plus highly-targeted and highly-measurable Facebook advertising have given rise to an increasing number of boutique CPG brands that deliver superior products to very targeted groups. On the low end, meanwhile, e-commerce not only reduces the shelf-space advantage but Amazon in particular is <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/amazon-private-label-facebook-audience-network-adds-video-ads/">moving into private label</a> in a big way.</li>
<li>Relatedly, big box retailers that offer few advantages beyond availability and low prices are being outdone by Amazon <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/amazon-private-label-facebook-audience-network-adds-video-ads/">on both counts</a>. In the very long run it is hard to see why they will continue to exist.</li>
<li>The automobile companies, meanwhile, are facing <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/cars-and-the-future/">three separate challenges</a>: electrification, transportation-as-a-service (i.e. Uber), and self-driving cars. The latter two in particular (and also the first to an extent) point to a world where cars are pure commodities bought by fleets, rendering advertising unnecessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other companies face less of a long-term threat, some because they are already commoditized — telecoms, credit cards, electronics — and others because they will probably grow: big movies are only getting bigger (entertainment), and the population is getting older (pharmaceuticals). Still, the inescapable reality is that TV advertisers are 20th century companies: built for mass markets, not niches, for brick-and-mortar retailers, not e-commerce. These companies were built on TV, and TV was built on their advertisements, and while they are propping each other up for now, the decline of one will hasten the decline of the other.</p>
<h4>TV Advertising&#8217;s Dead Cat Bounce</h4>
<p>I also suspect the nature of the biggest TV advertisers explains TV&#8217;s dead cat bounce: brands uniquely suited to TV are probably by definition less suited to digital advertising, which at least to date has worked much better for direct response marketing. No one is going to click a link in their feed to buy a car or laundry detergent, and a brick-and-mortar retailer doesn&#8217;t want to encourage shopping to someone already online. So after a bit of experimentation, they&#8217;re back with TV.</p>
<p>Still, I think Facebook and Snapchat in particular will figure brand advertising out: both have incredibly immersive advertising formats, and both are investing in ways to bring direct response-style tracking to brand advertising, including <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/snapchats-advertising-api-snapchat-versus-facebook-offline-tracking/">tracking visits to brick-and-mortar retailers</a>. It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if brand advertising on digital is following the hype cycle:</p>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/stratechery-Year-One-282.png"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/stratechery-Year-One-282-1024x768.png" alt="stratechery Year One - 282" width="640" height="480" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2193" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/stratechery-Year-One-282-1024x768.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/stratechery-Year-One-282-300x225.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/stratechery-Year-One-282-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>This is the story of most things Internet-related, not just narrowly but broadly: it&#8217;s no accident many of today&#8217;s startups are <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/unicorns/">repeating ideas from the dot com era</a>; it&#8217;s not that they were wrong but that they were too early. And, when it comes to old world companies, if you turn that graph upside down, the &#8220;trough of disillusionment&#8221; looks a lot like a bounce-back!</p>
<p>Ultimately, given the shift in attention, the threats faced by their best advertisers, and the oncoming train that is Facebook and Snapchat, were I a TV executive I wouldn&#8217;t get too excited about one nice week of ad sales. Indeed, the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/changing-unchanging-structure-tv/">industry has been shifting to subscriptions for years</a>, and while advertising will hold up for a while, the big drama is who will be left without a chair when the music stops.<sup><a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/tv-advertisings-surprising-strength-and-inevitable-fall/#footnote_2_2191" id="identifier_2_2191" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Viacom, for example">3</a></sup></p>
<h4>Coda: Aggregation Theory</h4>
<p>One more thing: I wrote a piece earlier this year called <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-fang-playbook/">The Fang Playbook</a> that posited that Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (plus Uber) were structurally very similar companies: all leveraged zero distribution costs and zero transaction costs to own users at scale via a superior experience that commoditized suppliers and let them skim off the middle, either through fees, subscriptions, or ads.<sup><a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/tv-advertisings-surprising-strength-and-inevitable-fall/#footnote_3_2191" id="identifier_3_2191" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Aka Aggregation Theory ">4</a></sup></p>
<p>What I described above is the opposite side of the coin: linear television and its advertisers were all predicated on owning distribution and thus owning customers. The Internet has or is in the process of destroying their business models for broadly similar reasons; for now the intertwinement of these models is keeping everyone afloat, but that only means that when the end comes it will come more swiftly and broadly than anyone is expecting.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Both Microsoft and Apple made news yesterday, and while one was unexpected and the other predictable, both are effectively doubling down on their strategies. And both may not matter.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been years since Microsoft upstaged an Apple Keynote (such things usually run in the opposite direction), but that is exactly what happened yesterday with the former&#8217;s $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn overshadowing Apple&#8217;s impressive yet iterative announcements at their annual Worldwide Developer&#8217;s Conference (WWDC). And yet, despite the contrast in expectations (zero versus high) and reactions (&#8220;What?!?&#8221; versus &#8220;Makes Sense&#8221;) there is a certain symmetry to the news: both are doubling down on their strategies, and it&#8217;s debatable which is taking the most risk by doing so.</p>
<h4>Microsoft Buys LinkedIn</h4>
<p>In its own small way perhaps the most surprising — and in many respects, encouraging — aspect of Microsoft&#8217;s purchase of LinkedIn was just how unexpected it was: a company with a notorious history of cutthroat boardroom politics not only pulled off the largest acquisition in its history without anyone knowing, it actually sat on the news regarding a signed letter of intent for a month! Granted, that meant limiting the information to an exceptionally small number of people, but there has been a lot of evidence over the past two years that Microsoft under CEO Satya Nadella has, at least at the highest levels of management, been more focused and aligned on where Microsoft needs to go than at any point under former CEO Steve Ballmer.</p>
<p>It was Steve Ballmer who led Microsoft&#8217;s previous largest acquisition, that of Nokia in 2013, a deal that <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/the-deal-that-makes-no-sense/">from day one made no sense</a> (and that was <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-05/microsoft-s-nadella-manages-legacy-of-ballmer-board-split">opposed by Nadella</a>). It is that deal, though, that is perhaps the best place to start from when it comes to understanding this one.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/apple-and-the-long-run-how-satya-nadella-killed-windows-phone/">marveled last month</a> at how adroitly Nadella had <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/apple-and-the-long-run-how-satya-nadella-killed-windows-phone/">killed the Windows Phone business</a> (or to put it more accurately, allowed Windows to figure out on their own that the platform had been dead from the beginning). The wind down of that business, though, and the ongoing shift of Windows to effectively &#8220;maintenance mode&#8221;, opens up room in Microsoft&#8217;s R&amp;D budget — about 13% of revenue — for something new, so why not LinkedIn? Leaving aside the purchase price, LinkedIn slides right into the Windows Phone void when it comes to Microsoft&#8217;s investment in the future, with the benefit of being a business that has actual upside.</p>
<p>I do believe that upside is magnified significantly by Microsoft: should LinkedIn&#8217;s <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/sales-solutions/sales-navigator">Sales Navigator</a>, for example, sell in to 100% of the Microsoft Dynamics CRM user base, a good portion of this deal would be paid for; on the flipside, Dynamics now becomes a much more compelling offering in its ongoing competition with Salesforce (the most likely candidate for the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-13/morgan-stanley-scores-with-microsoft-deal-surpassing-goldman">rumored competitive bidder</a>), Oracle, and SAP. And, of course, Microsoft&#8217;s Office products become that much more compelling with far deeper LinkedIn integration than was possible when they were two different companies (privacy concerns are much more easily solved when it&#8217;s the same company!).</p>
<p>I think, though, there is a deeper benefit that alters the trajectory of Microsoft&#8217;s productivity business in particular. I&#8217;ve <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/redmond-reality/">written previously</a> how Microsoft&#8217;s enterprise approach has been fundamentally upended by the cloud: when compatibility and ease-of-integration are no longer the controlling factors for IT buyers, Microsoft&#8217;s focus on lock-in and a good-enough user experience are simply not enough, and to the company&#8217;s credit both its Azure and Office 365 divisions have embraced a future that will be won on the user experience on all devices, not just Microsoft-controlled ones. Still, the question of who would own identity — previously the linchpin of Microsoft&#8217;s enterprise lock-in (thanks to Active Directory) — has been an open one.</p>
<p>What is potentially transformative about this deal is a future where Microsoft retains its focus on enterprise while shifting the locus of its business from companies to employees. I have <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/">written at length</a> about the importance of owning the end user, but we the end users have <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/multitudes-social/">multiple identities</a>, one of which is our professional life, and that is a graph in which LinkedIn is nearly unchallenged. To put it another way, the &#8220;consumerization of IT&#8221; — a tagline favored by Ballmer — it not only about creating a compelling user experience in IT products but about treating enterprise users as, well, consumers: with LinkedIn Microsoft can form a direct relationship with its end users that goes far beyond the CIO and opens up a huge array of opportunities that not only were unavailable previously, but are also critical in a world where CIOs matter less than they ever have previously, and where employees change jobs constantly. Instead of starting from scratch with every new hire, it is Microsoft that is positioned to provide the glue that connects enterprise workers no matter where they are.</p>
<p>And, for what it&#8217;s worth, Microsoft got a deal: I think LinkedIn&#8217;s <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-reality-of-missing-out/">February stock slide was justified</a>, but the fact remains that Microsoft is buying the social network for a price that would have been unthinkable six months ago, and the upside that justified the former stock price remains: LinkedIn knows more about its users than anyone outside of Facebook — and when it comes to our professional lives, they know more. This is the most valuable data in the world.</p>
<p>The most obvious criticism of this deal is the opportunity cost: what might that $26 billion have been spent on otherwise? Even with this deal <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/amazons-transformation-continued-microsofts-transformationand-threat/">Microsoft&#8217;s existential threat</a> remains: why would a new company buy any of their products? This acquisition doesn&#8217;t solve that in a way a pairing of, say, Dropbox and Slack would (two tastes that would be better together, and who also <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/amazon-echo-expand-the-nest-failure-microsoft-and-slack/">aren&#8217;t selling</a>), but then again, Microsoft has <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/daily-update-violate-privacy-like-professional-microsoft-acquires-acompli-amazons-kiva-cleverness/">far more money than they do time</a>: LinkedIn builds a bridge for their productivity business to a new world centered around end users, not corporations, and it may even give Microsoft&#8217;s inevitable compete products a head start. Imagine this: instead of simply moving Active Directory to the cloud, Microsoft is potentially making LinkedIn the central repository of identity for all business-based interactions: chat, email, and more, and it&#8217;s an identity that endures for an end user&#8217;s professional life, because it&#8217;s managed by the user, not by their transient employer. It&#8217;s genuinely exciting, and shocking though it may have been, I think that&#8217;s worth $26 billion.</p>
<p>More broadly, this has to be seen as the final blow to the notion that Windows is Microsoft&#8217;s focus; as <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/making-sense-microsoft/">late as 2014</a> I argued the company should split itself up, simply because the &#8220;Windows first&#8221; culture was so entrenched, but Nadella has done a remarkable job reorganizing and reorienting the company towards a future where Windows is one of many clients for Microsoft&#8217;s service offerings, and if it wasn&#8217;t clear to the rank-and-file yet, it surely must be now. Microsoft is doubling-down on the cloud and on productivity, and now there are 26 billion reasons to believe them.</p>
<h4>Apple at WWDC</h4>
<p>Apple&#8217;s WWDC announcements, meanwhile, were perhaps most notable for what they <em>didn&#8217;t</em> include, including no mention of <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/wwdc-preview-line-files-for-ipo-yahoo-twitter-snapchat-and-messaging/">iMessage on Android</a>, and no significant discussion about Siri beyond the rumored and sorely needed incremental improvements (and even there, somewhat limited: Siri&#8217;s API is only open to a subset of applications).</p>
<p>Instead the keynote was about enhancing and deepening the value that comes from living the full Apple lifestyle: now your Watch unlocks your Mac, and your desktop is available on your iPhone. You can pay for things in your Mac&#8217;s browser using the iPhone, and control your house via the Apple TV from your lock screen. And yes, Messages got a massive update that I am very excited about (more tomorrow as I review the keynote in-depth), but its features are only available if you&#8217;re messaging other iPhone users: pay up or get left out.</p>
<p>Just as notable were the new things that <em>weren&#8217;t</em> announced: Apple is <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204221">allowing users to delete pre-installed apps</a>, and while there is no news about defining new default apps, should Apple do so the company would be on the path towards making its hardware mastery even more compelling by virtue of enabling services companies like Google and Microsoft to enhance the experience of using an iPhone.</p>
<p>This enhancement, of course, theoretically <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/apple-and-the-long-run-how-satya-nadella-killed-windows-phone/">weakens Apple in the long run</a>, as it squanders the ability of the company to leverage its hardware advantage into a services lock-in, but given <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-curse-of-culture/">my conviction on the power of culture</a> I&#8217;m not sure this is a bad thing; here Steve Jobs&#8217; <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/12974884/">advice</a> rings true:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I think if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what’s next.
</p></blockquote>
<p>For Apple what is next should almost certainly be guided by what the company is the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/best/">best</a> at: integrating hardware and software to deliver a user experience so compelling that consumers continue to self-select into the company&#8217;s own orbit, not building infrastructure on top of platforms it doesn&#8217;t control.</p>
<p>That, though, is also what made me nervous about the company&#8217;s announcements. CEO Tim Cook emphasized at the beginning of the keynote, in his words, &#8220;why we do what we do at Apple.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-14-at-6.04.37-AM.png"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-14-at-6.04.37-AM-1024x670.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-06-14 at 6.04.37 AM" width="640" height="419" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2181" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-14-at-6.04.37-AM-1024x670.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-14-at-6.04.37-AM-300x196.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-14-at-6.04.37-AM-768x502.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>  Our North Star has always been about improving people&#8217;s lives by creating great products that change the world.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Several of the product announcements, though, like enhancements to photos and Siri, seemed to care more about an absolutist view of privacy than about the best possible end user experience; make no mistake, I value privacy, but everything is a trade-off. At what point might Apple&#8217;s strenuous defense of privacy shift from a principled stand to <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/tim-cooks-unfair-and-unrealistic-privacy-speech-strategy-credits-the-privacy-priority-problem/">a convenient reason to not be competitive</a> with alternatives like Google photos or Alexa? Or, to put it another way, when does principle become an excuse for not being competitive on the user experience that has been Apple&#8217;s biggest differentiator for its entire existence?</p>
<h4>Apple Versus Microsoft</h4>
<p>Apple&#8217;s keynote was notable for its having doubled-down on what the company excels at: providing a better experience provided you pay Apple&#8217;s hardware margins. In this their announcement echoes Microsoft&#8217;s decision to double down on owning professional productivity and services. The difference, though, is in the timing: Microsoft is (finally) pivoting to the approach they should have adopted a decade ago, and while that has cost the company a lot of time and increased their risk, it is exciting to see them closer to the beginning than the end of their strategy. The question for Apple is where on that spectrum do they lie: for <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/everything-as-a-service/">how long will a hardware-centric strategy drive growth</a>, and just how much is Apple willing to <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/apples-organizational-crossroads/">change its culture</a> to ensure it takes advantage of new opportunities and not simply preserve what it has?</p>
<p>Or maybe it doesn&#8217;t matter: odds are the biggest news from Monday will be <a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/snapchat-launches-colossal-expansion-its-advertising-ushering-new-era-app-171924">Snapchat&#8217;s launch of an advertising API</a>; the world goes on, value moves up the stack, and attention to the &#8220;story of the day&#8221; is all too often a trailing indicator.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I like driving, even if I end up sitting in traffic. I enjoy doing the laundry, and take my time folding shirts just so. I volunteer to wash the dishes. After all, each of these activities is an excuse to listen to more podcasts.<sup><a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-future-of-podcasting/#footnote_0_2170" id="identifier_0_2170" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I mostly listen to sports podcasts, primarily NBA, so no need to email for my list of recommendations &#x1f642; ">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been listening to podcasts for over a decade now; I don&#8217;t remember exactly when I got started but it was around the time that <a href="https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/06/28Apple-Takes-Podcasting-Mainstream.html">Apple Took Podcasting Mainstream</a>: that&#8217;s from the title of the press release announcing iTunes support for podcasts in 2005. Given that most podcasts were listened to on iPods (thus the name) that already synced with iTunes, Apple&#8217;s move dramatically simplified the distribution of podcasts: simply click a button in the music management app you already used, hook up the iPod as you already did, and voilà! New podcasts ready to be listened to in the car (via your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_tape_adaptor">cassette tape adaptor</a>), while doing laundry, washing the dishes, etc. It was great!</p>
<p>It also was not in the slightest bit mainstream: <a href="http://www.edisonresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Podcast-Consumer-2016.pdf">according to Edison Research</a>, in 2006 only 22% of Americans were even familiar with the term &#8220;podcasting&#8221;, and only 11% had ever listened to one. Both numbers have slowly but steadily grown over the years (55% have heard of podcasting as of this year, and 36% have listened to one, and there actually isn&#8217;t a readily apparent &#8216;Serial&#8217; bump), aided in large part by the smartphone: by removing the need to sync with iTunes it was much easier to have fresh podcasts at the ready. Still, there remained the challenge of creating compelling content, discovering content worth listening to, retaining listeners and, of course, paying for it all.</p>
<h4>Podcasting Versus Blogging</h4>
<p>Late last year Joshua Benton wrote that <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/11/podcasting-in-2015-feels-a-lot-like-blogging-circa-2004-exciting-evolving-and-trouble-for-incumbents/">Podcasting in 2015 Feels a Lot Like Blogging Circa 2004</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Podcasting is giving me a case of déjà vu…The variety and quality of work being done is thrilling; outside attention is growing; new formats are evolving. We’re seeing the same unlocking of creative potential we saw with blogging, and there’s far more good work being produced than anyone has time to take in. The question now is whether podcasting’s future will play out as the last decade of blogging has.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s a good observation, but there are important differences if you look into the various factors I alluded to above:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creation:</strong> Blogger was released back in 1999, and WordPress in 2003; both required some level of acumen, but significantly less than recording and mixing a podcast takes today. It&#8217;s also very complicated to get a show actually listed in iTunes. This means, by extension, that for all the great podcasts there are today, there were that many more blogs.</li>
<li><strong>Distribution:</strong> Blogs could be read via URLs typed in a browser that everyone already used. Podcasts are much more complicated: you either have to search a 3rd-party podcast player&#8217;s directory (iTunes or self-contained) to add a show, or copy-and-paste a feed address. Alternately, you can simply listen on a website, but that is a suboptimal experience to say the least.</li>
<li><strong>Discovery:</strong> In 2004 most blogs were found from links on more popular blogs; today new blogs are usually discovered on social networks. Podcasts, meanwhile, really struggle here: yes, iTunes has a front page and a blackbox ranking system, but the requirement to download a file and spend time listening makes it hard to spread virally. Many podcasts are instead built off of established brands like NPR or the personal brands of the podcast hosts.</li>
<li><strong>Retention:</strong> Back in 2004 most blog readers returned via bookmarks; more advanced users leveraged RSS readers that polled sites for new content and downloaded it in a feed. Today, most readers rely on social network posts that may or may not be seen. Interestingly, it is here that podcasts have an advantage: because they are built on RSS, anyone who &#8220;subscribes&#8221; through a podcast player downloads podcasts automatically and even gets notifications, making for a very sticky and loyal audience.</li>
<li><strong>Monetization:</strong> Blogging had a brief honeymoon period where you could actually make money with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdSense">Google AdSense</a>, but revenue soon plummeted as inventory drastically increased; more devastating, not just for bloggers but all publishers, was Facebook&#8217;s absorption of not just what used to be blogging content but also publishing dollars. Increasingly, the best option for publishers is to simply publish directly to Facebook and let them sell ads.</li>
</ul>
<p>The monetization of podcasts, meanwhile, deserves a deeper dive.</p>
<h4>The Problem with Monetizing Podcasts</h4>
<p>Podcasting is still a tiny business: <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/podcasts-face-advertising-hurdles-1455745492">according to the Wall Street Journal</a> podcasts only attracted $34 million in advertising revenue last year, about 1/100th the amount spend on <em>billboards</em> (This number is disputed by many of the bigger podcasters, but the <a href="https://www.hotpodnews.com/2016/06/scripps-acquires-stitcher-midroll-ceo-steps-down-hivio-2016/">highest estimate I&#8217;ve seen</a> is $200 million, i.e. 1/15th of billboards). The biggest player in the podcast advertising market is a company called Midroll Media, which was <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ew-scripps-acquires-podcast-network-810326">acquired by E.W. Scripps</a> last year for $50 million (with a $10 million earn-out).</p>
<p>Midroll sells ads for over 200 podcasts, including some of the most popular ones like <a href="http://www.wtfpod.com">WTF with Marc Maron</a> and the <a href="https://theringer.com/the-ringer-podcast-network-78792908eaff#.udqndd5fy">Bill Simmons Podcast</a>. The not-so-secret reality about podcast ads, though, are that advertisers are quite concentrated: <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/but-first-a-word-from-100-podcast-sponsors/">a FiveThirtyEight intern</a> heroically listened to the top 100 shows on the iTunes chart and counted 186 ads; 35 percent of them were from five companies.<sup><a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-future-of-podcasting/#footnote_1_2170" id="identifier_1_2170" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Squarespace had 30, Stamps.com 12, Audible 11, MailChimp 8, and Dollar Shave Club 5">2</a></sup> More tellingly, nearly all of the ads were of the direct marketing variety.</p>
<p>A major challenge in podcast monetization is the complete lack of data: listeners still download MP3s and that&#8217;s the end of it; podcasters can measure downloads, but have no idea if the episode is actually listened to, for how long, or whether or not the ads are skipped. In a complete reversal from the online world of text, the measurement system is a big step <em>backwards</em> from what came before: both radio and TV have an established measurement system for what shows are watched, and the scale of advertising is such that surveys can measure advertising effectiveness. Thus the direct marketing advertisers: they can simply do the measurement themselves through coupon codes or special URLs that measure how many people responded to a podcast ad. It&#8217;s not totally efficient — some number of conversions forget the code or URL — but it&#8217;s something.</p>
<p>It also won&#8217;t scale. For the advertisers that exist the implication of measuring by code or URL is that every single podcast needs customized support, limiting advertising opportunities to bigger podcasts only. More importantly, there simply aren&#8217;t that many advertisers with the sort of business model that can justify the hassle. The real money in TV and especially radio is brand advertising; brand advertising is focused on building affinity for a purchase that will happen at some indefinite point in the future, so the focus is less on conversion and more on targeting: knowing in broad strokes who is listening to an ad, and exactly how many people. For podcasting to ever be a true moneymaker it has to tap into that — and that means changing the fundamental nature of the product.</p>
<h4>Midroll Makes Their Move</h4>
<p>Yesterday Scripps/Midroll made another acquisition, this time of the podcast player Stitcher. From the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/e-w-scripps-buys-podcast-company-stitcher-1465239600">Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Stitcher is a free app that streams more than 65,000 podcasts from publishers ranging from NPR to MSNBC to The Wall Street Journal. It will operate under Midroll Media, the podcast advertising company that Scripps acquired last year…</p>
<p>  “We certainly have the ad sales force and the connections that make us a leader in the space, but today we depend almost exclusively on distribution into other channels,” said Adam Symson, chief digital officer at Scripps. “This puts in place, with a very strong brand, another piece of the puzzle in the ecosystem play.”</p>
<p>  As new listeners and shows enter the podcast world, companies in the space have been contending with a handful of industry challenges, like measuring audience size and wooing big brand marketers. “For the first time we’ll have significantly more ability to help with podcast discovery, to help with distribution, to help shows grow, and to help find out what audiences want in a way that we could not do before,” Mr. Diehn said.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Stitcher is thought to be the 2nd most popular podcast player, although <a href="http://nerdist.com/the-stitcher-situation/">it has long been controversial in some circles</a> for its default practice of hosting podcasts itself (instead of directing users to download them directly from a podcaster&#8217;s server) and inserting ads. That model, though, was likely attractive to Scripps/Midroll: controlling the files and the player means the possibility of making meaningful measurements of play data plus dynamic ad insertion at scale.</p>
<p>Moreover, Midroll&#8217;s leading role in advertising combined with Scripps&#8217; bank account mean the company could offer big bucks to leading podcasters to make themselves exclusive to Stitcher, driving users to the measurable app to the long-term benefit of the company&#8217;s efforts to attract brand advertisers. To be very clear, there are a lot of obstacles to this actually happening, but the idea of there being a central aggregator for podcasts that locks in podcasters through superior monetization and listeners through exclusive content is both plausible and attractive from a business perspective.</p>
<h4>Publishers Beware</h4>
<p>Popular podcaster and blogger Marco Arment has been <a href="https://marco.org/2016/05/07/apple-role-in-podcasting">particularly vocal</a> about the problems with this approach; more pertinently, <a href="https://marco.org/2015/10/13/pragmatic-pricing">Arment says</a> he built the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/overcast-podcast-player/id888422857?mt=8">Overcast podcasting app</a> to resist this outcome:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Podcasts are hot right now. Big Money is coming. Big Money isn’t going to sell nicely designed, hand-crafted, RSS-backed podcast players for $2.99 or ask you to pay what you want to support them, because that doesn’t make Big Money. They’re coming with shitty apps and fantastic business deals to dominate the market, lock down this open medium into proprietary “technology”, and build empires of middlemen to control distribution and take a cut of everyone’s revenue…I don’t know if Overcast stands a chance of preventing the Facebookization of podcasting, but I know I’m increasing the odds if my app is free without restrictions. As long as I can make money some other way, I’m fine.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That phrase — &#8220;the Facebookization of podcasting&#8221; — should send chills down the spine of all the publishing companies jumping headfirst into podcasting. Publishers are <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/facebook-reckoning/">already &#8220;serfs in a kingdom that Facebook owns&#8221;</a> by virtue of the fact that <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/popping-the-publishing-bubble/">Facebook owns user attention <em>and</em> has superior advertising capabilities</a>. And yet many publishers are so focused on finding new income streams that they are practically begging for exactly what Arment fears.</p>
<p>Early last month the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/business/media/podcasts-surge-apple.html?_r=0">New York Times</a> suggested many publishers hoped the Facebook of podcasting would be Apple; thanks to that 2005 release the company and its directory remain the center of the podcasting industry, and iTunes and its iOS podcast app are are responsible for a reported 65 percent share of podcast listeners. Indeed, this is the biggest reason to doubt Midroll&#8217;s plans: as difficult as it can be to corral advertisers, switching the habits of millions of listeners in the face of a default experience is far more difficult.</p>
<h4>A Third Way</h4>
<p>All that said, I&#8217;m not sure the status quo of podcasters hosting their own MP3 files listed in a (relatively) open directory mostly ignored by Apple is sustainable, or even desirable: relatively large independent podcasters like Arment may prefer the current setup, but there is an increasing amount of money and agitation for building something that looks a lot like Midroll&#8217;s presumed plans for Stitcher. Apple itself, with its dominant position in podcasting and its <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/twitter-follow-up-apples-good-earnings-apple-is-not-a-services-company/">newfound focus on services revenue</a> in the face of declining iPhone sales, is not only well-placed but also increasingly motivated to fill that role itself.</p>
<p>More importantly, though, for publishers podcasting really is a great opportunity to build something sustainable. In <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/grantland-and-the-surprising-future-of-publishing/">Grantland and the (Surprising) Future of Publishing</a> I explained how media companies need to expand their thinking about monetization:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Too much of the debate about monetization and the future of publishing in particular has artificially restricted itself to monetizing text. That constraint made sense in a physical world: a business that invested heavily in printing presses and delivery trucks didn’t really have a choice but to stick the product and the business model together…</p>
<p>  Focused, quality-obsessed publications [should]…collect “stars” and monetize them through…alternate media forms. Said media forms, like podcasts, are tough to grow on their own, but again, that is what makes them such a great match for writing, which is perfect for growth but terrible for monetization.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Go back to the five factors that go into effective media: both text and podcasts are relatively easy to create, but text is much easier to distribute and discover; the most effective podcasts, meanwhile, are those driven by brands or personalities; podcasts in general are great at retaining loyal listeners; and their monetization potential is much higher if the measurement can be figured out.</p>
<p>A Stitcher/Apple-type solution does help on that last point, but it still makes distribution and discovery harder than they should be: a publisher has to tell its readers to go to a different app, search for their name, subscribe, and then depend on that 3rd party app for monetization and measurement. Wouldn&#8217;t it be better if the publisher simply did that themselves?</p>
<p>I think there is a third way here, that preserves independence but starts to solve the monetization and measurement problem: publishers should offer podcasts through their own app that measures listens, and either sell ads themselves if they have the scale or outsource it to a company like Midroll.<sup><a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-future-of-podcasting/#footnote_2_2170" id="identifier_2_2170" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I&rsquo;m using Midroll as a standin, but this role could be filled by any company">3</a></sup> Midroll, for their part, should leverage their new player technology to offer skinnable apps for publishers who can&#8217;t build their own. The end result would be a much smoother path for publishers to convert their readers to listeners — and to effectively cross-promote — along with the measurement and scale needed to grow advertising meaningfully (or even offer subscriptions).<sup><a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-future-of-podcasting/#footnote_3_2170" id="identifier_3_2170" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Also, there&rsquo;s no need for publishers to fear the App Store: Apple doesn&rsquo;t take a skim off of advertising, and the App Store infrastructure would actually make subscriptions viable">4</a></sup></p>
<p>I know this breaks the modern concept of podcasting, and power users with tens of subscriptions in their podcasting player of choice will be annoyed if they have to download multiple apps. Often, though, a solution that works for power users is actually prohibitive for normal users, and the other solution — a Facebook of podcasts — would be worse for everyone. Just look at what happened to RSS readers: yes, Google killed them, but it was only ever used by a fraction of readers before then because they were too difficult; Facebook, on the other hand, was easy.<sup><a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-future-of-podcasting/#footnote_4_2170" id="identifier_4_2170" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="To be clear, I love RSS! And it underpins a lot of the web, including Facebook Instant Articles. But I&rsquo;m talking about the mass market and monetization">5</a></sup> Fortunately for publishers, the challenges of podcast discovery and distribution actually make apps the easiest choice of all.<sup><a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-future-of-podcasting/#footnote_5_2170" id="identifier_5_2170" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Yes Newsstand was a failure; however, the entire premise of this article is that text is different than audio">6</a></sup></p>
<p>There are plenty of good reasons why the publishing world ended up subservient to Facebook, but to answer Benton&#8217;s question as to &#8220;whether podcasting’s future will play out as the last decade of blogging has&#8221;, I don&#8217;t think it has to. The limitations of audio relative to text actually work to the publishers&#8217; advantage in a way that the portability of text did not, and this may be their last chance to build destinations that people will wash the dishes in order to visit.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[What Gawker did to Peter Thiel is inexcusable, but Thiel's response is threatening to the industry that made him rich in the first place.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Andrew Ross Sorkin in the <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/business/dealbook/peter-thiel-tech-billionaire-reveals-secret-war-with-gawker.html?_r=0&amp;referer=">New York Times DealBook</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  A billionaire Silicon Valley entrepreneur was outed as being gay by a media organization. His friends suffered at the hands of the same gossip site. Nearly a decade later, the entrepreneur secretly financed a lawsuit to try to put the media company out of business.</p>
<p>  That is the back story to a legal case that had already grabbed headlines: The wrestler Hulk Hogan sued Gawker Media for invasion of privacy after it published a sex tape, and a Florida jury recently awarded the wrestler, whose real name is Terry Gene Bollea, $140 million. What the jury — and the public — did not know was that Mr. Bollea had a secret benefactor paying about $10 million for the lawsuit: Peter Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal and one of the earliest investors in Facebook.
</p></blockquote>
<p>If ever there were a case with no one to cheer for, this is it: Gawker does do good work, but they do really terrible things as well, and their outing of Thiel despite <a href="http://gawker.com/335894/peter-thiel-is-totally-gay-people?comment=3414140#comments">his explicit request not to</a> is indefensible. It disgusts me, and my disgust is only deepened by the moralizing and righteousness of <a href="http://gawker.com/335894/peter-thiel-is-totally-gay-people">the post in question</a>, as if Gawker has the right to make the most personal of decisions for anyone.</p>
<p>It is also legal and protected speech.</p>
<p>Thiel, meanwhile, is being a bully of the first order. He is attempting to run Gawker out of business — this lawsuit he is funding is one of many, and he has lawyers looking for more — in part because he can, and in part because he has styled himself as a twisted version of Batman: a vigilante who is not so much above the law (what he is doing is also perfectly legal), but rather one who uses the law to first and foremost avenge himself even as he spins a story about his defense of the vulnerable. Thiel told Sorkin:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “It’s less about revenge and more about specific deterrence,” he said on Wednesday in his first interview since his identity was revealed. “I saw Gawker pioneer a unique and incredibly damaging way of getting attention by bullying people even when there was no connection with the public interest.” Mr. Thiel said that Gawker published articles that were “very painful and paralyzing for people who were targeted.” He said, “I thought it was worth fighting back.”</p>
<p>  Mr. Thiel added: “I can defend myself. Most of the people they attack are not people in my category. They usually attack less prominent, far less wealthy people that simply can’t defend themselves.” He said that “even someone like Terry Bollea who is a millionaire and famous and a successful person didn’t quite have the resources to do this alone.” Mr. Thiel said that he had decided several years ago to set his plan in motion. “I didn’t really want to do anything,” he said. “I thought it would do more harm to me than good. One of my friends convinced me that if I didn’t do something, nobody would.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>What a hero.</p>
<h4>The Conditions of Superheroes</h4>
<p>In one of the more <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/2876836/captain-america-civil-war-and-the-superhero-insecurity-state/">thought-provoking essays</a> I have read all year Brian Phillips put his finger on how comic book hero movies have, in his words, &#8220;become vehicles for talking about larger social issues&#8221;, particularly the exercise of power in a post 9/11 world:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In the world of these films, there were no mutants or “enhanced humans” or benevolent alien overseers within living memory. Society was more or less just like our society. Then superheroes arrived. A line was crossed. Things changed. There is always, in these movies, a sense that the world has gone a little crazy, that we are dealing with a new order whose rules no one really knows. And that newness partly explains the extreme focus on the problem of whether and how the abilities of the heroes can be accommodated within the existing framework of governments and laws and the popular will.</p>
<p>  The other explanation for that focus is an irony that, when you start to lay it out, is kind of gobsmacking, and that gets at an almost Greek-tragic dimension of recent comic-book movies. (Let’s say Norse-tragic, because Thor.) The irony is this: The superheroes in superhero movies are always the only force capable of saving humanity from the threats it faces. But with astounding regularity in post-9/11 comic-book films, the threats mankind has to be saved from were either unleashed by the heroes themselves, came into being simultaneously with the heroes, or both. In other words, the chaos from which the heroes are required to save the world is implicit in the heroes’ being in the world in the first place; even when the protagonists aren’t actually the authors of the crisis they are fighting against — something that, again, happens with startling frequency — they are manifestations of the same fundamental shift.
</p></blockquote>
<p>From this perspective, it could not be more perfect that Thiel made the largest part of his fortune by investing in Facebook, where he still sits on the board. Facebook specifically and the Internet broadly has made it possible for sensationalistic rags like Gawker to exist, even as it has fundamentally weakened journalism by destroying the geographic monopolies that guaranteed the financial freedom to <a href="http://www.poynter.org/2014/today-in-media-history-mr-dooley-the-job-of-the-newspaper-is-to-comfort-the-afflicted-and-afflict-the-comfortable/273081/">comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable</a>. Thiel as the personification of the tech industry is very much the superhero looking to remedy a problem he created.</p>
<h4>Vigilantism and Unintended Consequences</h4>
<p>And so, as is the case with the superhero movies Phillips describes, who you think is right depends on your perspective. Narrowly speaking, it is hard to fault Thiel — hell, the fact he was willing to wait eight-and-a-half years to exact the revenge he promised Gawker publisher Nick Denton should he out him is almost admirable, and in a weird way likely explains why Thiel has such an unbelievable track record as both an entrepreneur and investor (Paypal and Palantir as an entrepreneur, Facebook, LinkedIn, Yelp, Stripe, Yammer among many others as an investor). Gawker did him wrong and he is exacting his revenge on a time scale far more expansive than Denton likely thought possible.</p>
<p>Again, though, <em>Thiel has already won</em>. He is fabulously wealthy and extremely influential, and say what you will about Gawker, the liberal democracy that made it possible for the companies Thiel has built and invested in to emerge depends on a free press; driving a publication to bankruptcy via lawyer fees may be legal by the letter of the law, and even deserved on a personal level, but it is in absolute violation of the <em>spirit</em> of the law and, I might add, a rather hypocritical — or is it ironic? — use of government by the avowed libertarian Thiel. What are more concerning, though — and implicit in this concern is a critique of libertarianism — are the second and third-order effects of Thiel&#8217;s approach.</p>
<p>The most obvious second-order effect is that, as <a href="http://fusion.net/story/306927/peter-thiel-gawker-dangerous-blueprint/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialshare&amp;utm_content=sticky+nav_desktop">Felix Salmon writes</a>, Thiel is providing a blueprint for the suppression of the press by the wealthy. But what concerns me — and what ought to concern Thiel, and all of the Silicon Valley elites celebrating his actions — are the third order effects. Specifically, Thiel&#8217;s actions are bringing into stark relief the fundamental weakness of old analog businesses like journalism relative to the incredible power and strength of the technology sector, and if companies follow Thiel&#8217;s example, the freedom that makes the emergence of said companies possible could quickly come under threat — and deservedly so.</p>
<p>Consider Facebook: I have <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/defending-facebook-amazon-video-direct/">argued strenuously</a> that the idea of Facebook consciously abusing its unprecedented power over what people see is absolutely a problem in theory, but one that is contained by Facebook&#8217;s own incentives and the fact that the alternative — government regulation of speech — is even more undesirable. At the same time, I am troubled by the societal impact broadly of Facebook&#8217;s efforts to be neutral via algorithm and the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-real-problem-with-facebook-and-the-news/">potentially destructive impact</a> that has on our politics in particular. What is truly alarming, though, is the prospect of a company specifically and an industry broadly that is convinced of its own righteousness, unconscious of its own power, and blind to what it doesn&#8217;t know, making decisions with unintended consequences — <a href="http://www.wsj.com/article_email/SB10000872396390444165804578008740578200224-lMyQjAxMTAyMDEwMjAxODI3Wj.html">like outing LGBTQ people at scale</a>.</p>
<p>Truthfully, though, Facebook is one of many (and has proven itself to be rather benign, in my estimation). You don&#8217;t need to go a block in SOMA or a mile down El Camino Real to encounter any number of companies full of people attracted by shared backgrounds and experiences that are &#8220;changing the world&#8221;, fueled by little more than a cult-like devotion to mission and a bank account full of money betting on the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/antitrust-and-aggregation/">market-monopolizing effects of Internet economics</a>. And — this is the scary part for the industry — the more those companies are not just successful, but abusive in their obliviousness to the societal impact of that success, the greater the likelihood that the only possible countervailing force — the government — will have no choice but to give in to the certain backlash and interfere.</p>
<p>In other words, the avowed libertarian is, in some small way, showing the way in which the government interference that he claims to detest might come to bear — as a response to unconsidered abuses of power — all in the service of settling scores made possible by the industry that made him rich.</p>
<h4>Power and Responsibility</h4>
<p>Here&#8217;s the fact of the matter: what Gawker did (and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gawker-conde-nast-david-geithner_us_55a90c56e4b0c5f0322d0b2c">still does</a>) is wrong, but it&#8217;s wrong in the way that — and forgive the seriousness and political nature of this analogy, but I think it captures my point — Saddam Hussein was an awful dictator who murdered his own people. Taking him out may have been satisfying and justifiable in a narrow sense, but at what cost to the United States in both treasure and broader legitimacy?</p>
<p>The tech industry, like Thiel, is no underdog: it is the dominant economic force not just in the United States but in the entire world, both because of the wealth it creates, but especially because of the wealth it destroys. And, to quote another comic book figure, &#8220;With great power comes great responsibility&#8221;.</p>
<p>In this case, no matter how badly Thiel was personally hurt by Gawker, or how morally wrong their actions were, he is the one with far greater power, and the appropriate approach is not to leverage said power in an act of vigilantism, but to exercise the responsibility of defending the conditions that made his power possible to emerge, conditions that I believe are to the long-term benefit of everyone. <em>That</em> would be an approach worth applauding and emulating, not just because it&#8217;s the right thing to do, but because the freedom that made possible the tech industry that made Thiel rich depends on it.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[It is very fair to say that Apple is threatened by the potential rise of AI. Google, though, is also threatened by its inability to own customers' attention. The solution for both companies may entail changing their culture, a very tall order indeed.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the seminal books on culture is Edgar Schein&#8217;s <a href="http://as.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470185864.html">Organizational Culture and Leadership</a>. Schein writes in the introduction:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of culture as a concept is that it points us to phenomena that are below the surface, that are powerful in their impact but invisible and to a considerable degree unconscious. In that sense, culture is to a group what personality or character is to an individual. We can see the behavior that results, but often we cannot see the forces underneath that cause certain kinds of behavior. Yet, just as our personality and character guide and constrain our behavior, so does culture guide and constrain the behavior of members of a group through the shared norms that are held in that group.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In Schein&#8217;s telling, things like ping pong tables and kegerators are two (small) examples of <em>artifacts</em> — the visible qualities of an organization. They are easy to observe but their meaning is usually indecipherable and unique to a particular group (to put it another way, copying Google&#8217;s perks is missing the point).</p>
<p>The next level down are espoused beliefs and values, what everyone in an organization understands consciously: &#8220;openness,&#8221; for example, or &#8220;the customer is always right&#8221;; as you might expect espoused beliefs and values devolve rather easily into cliché.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the third level that truly matters: underlying assumptions. Schein writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Basic assumptions, in the sense in which I want to define that concept, have become so taken for granted that one finds little variation within a social unit. This degree of consensus results from repeated success in implementing certain beliefs and values, as previously described. In fact, if a basic assumption comes to be strongly held in a group, members will find behavior based on any other premise inconceivable.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The implications of this definition are profound: culture is not something that begets success, rather, it is a product of it. All companies start with the espoused beliefs and values of their founder(s), but until those beliefs and values are proven correct and successful they are open to debate and change. If, though, they lead to real sustained success, then those values and beliefs slip from the conscious to the unconscious, and it is this transformation that allows companies to maintain the &#8220;secret sauce&#8221; that drove their initial success even as they scale. The founder no longer needs to espouse his or her beliefs and values to the 10,000th employee; every single person already in the company will do just that, in every decision they make, big or small.</p>
<h4>Microsoft&#8217;s Blindness</h4>
<p>As with most such things, culture is one of a company&#8217;s most powerful assets right until it isn&#8217;t: the same underlying assumptions that permit an organization to scale massively constrain the ability of that same organization to change direction. More distressingly, culture prevents organizations from even knowing they need to do so. Schein continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Basic assumptions, like theories-in-use, tend to be nonconfrontable and nondebatable, and hence are extremely difficult to change. To learn something new in this realm requires us to resurrect, reexamine, and possibly change some of the more stable portions of our cognitive structure…Such learning is intrinsically difficult because the reexamination of basic assumptions temporarily destabilizes our cognitive and interpersonal world, releasing large quantities of basic anxiety. Rather than tolerating such anxiety levels, we tend to want to perceive the events around us as congruent with our assumptions, even if that means distorting, denying, projecting, or in other ways falsifying to ourselves what may be going on around us. It is in this psychological process that culture has its ultimate power.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Probably the canonical example of this mindset was Microsoft after the launch of the iPhone. It&#8217;s hard to remember now, but no company today comes close to matching the stranglehold Microsoft had on the computing industry from 1985 to 2005 or so.<sup><a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-curse-of-culture/#footnote_0_2149" id="identifier_0_2149" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Yes, Apple ultimately came to earn much more revenue that Microsoft ever did, and Google has come close, but both did so in the context of a much larger industry">1</a></sup> The company had audacious goals — &#8220;A computer on every desk and in every home, running Microsoft software&#8221; — which it accomplished and then surpassed: the company owned enterprise back offices as well. This unprecedented success changed that goal — originally an espoused belief — into an unquestioned assumption that of course all computers should be Microsoft-powered. Given this, the real shock would have been then-CEO Steve Ballmer <em>not</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eywi0h_Y5_U">laughing at the iPhone</a>.</p>
<p>A year-and-a-half later, Microsoft realized that Windows Mobile, their current phone OS, was not competitive with the iPhone and work began on what became Windows Phone. Still, unacknowledged cultural assumptions remained: one, that Microsoft had the time to bring to bear its unmatched resources to make something that might be worse at the beginning but inevitably superior over time, and two, that the company could leverage Windows&#8217; dominance and their Office business. Both assumptions had become cemented in Microsoft&#8217;s victory in the browser wars and their slow-motion takeover of corporate data centers; in truth, though, Microsofts&#8217; mobile efforts were already doomed, and nearly everyone realized it before Windows Phone even launched <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/10/microsoft-celebrates-windows-phone-7-rtm-with-funeral-parade-for/">with a funeral for the iPhone</a>.</p>
<p>Steve Ballmer never figured it out; his last acts were to <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/why-microsofts-reorganization-is-a-bad-idea/">reorganize the company</a> around a &#8220;One Microsoft&#8221; strategy centered on Windows, and to <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/the-deal-that-makes-no-sense/">buy Nokia</a> to prop up Windows Phone. It fell to Satya Nadella, his successor, to change the culture, and it&#8217;s why the fact his first public event was to announce Office for iPad was so critical. I <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/when-ceos-matter/">wrote at the time</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  This is the power CEOs have. They cannot do all the work, and they cannot impact industry trends beyond their control. But they can choose whether or not to accept reality, and in so doing, impact the worldview of all those they lead.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Microsoft under Nadella&#8217;s leadership has, over the last three years, undergone a tremendous transformation, embracing its destiny as a device-agnostic service provider; still, it is fighting the headwinds of Amazon&#8217;s cloud, open source tooling, and the fact that mobile users had six years to get used to a world without Microsoft software. How much stronger might the company have been had it faced reality in 2007, but the culture made that impossible.</p>
<h4>Steve Jobs&#8217; Leadership</h4>
<p>Shein defines leadership in the context of culture:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  When we examine culture and leadership closely, we see that they are two sides of the same coin; neither can really be understood by itself. On the one hand, cultural norms define how a given nation or organizations will define leadership—who will get promoted, who will get the attention of followers. On the other hand, it can be argued that the only thing of real importance that leaders do is to create and manage culture; that the unique talent of leaders is their ability to understand and work with culture; and that it is an ultimate act of leadership to destroy culture when it is viewed as dysfunctional.
</p></blockquote>
<p>A great example of this sort of destruction was Steve Jobs&#8217; first keynote as interim CEO at <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/steve-jobs-at-macworld-boston-in-1997/">the 1997 Boston Macworld</a>, specifically the announcement of Apple&#8217;s shocking partnership with Microsoft:</p>
<div align="center"><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PEHNrqPkefI?start=1571;rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>When Jobs said the word Microsoft, the audience audibly groaned. A few minutes later, when Jobs clicked to a slide that said Internet Explorer would be the default browser on Macintosh, the audience booed so loudly that Jobs had to stop speaking. When Jobs finally said the actual words &#8220;default browser&#8221; the audience booed even louder, with several individuals shouting &#8220;No!&#8221; It is, given the context of today&#8217;s Apple keynotes, shocking to watch.</p>
<p>Then, after Bill Gates spoke to the crowd via satellite (in what Jobs would call his &#8220;worst and stupidest staging event ever&#8221;), Jobs launched into what his biographer Walter Isaacson called an &#8220;impromptu sermon&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If we want to move forward and see Apple healthy and prospering again, we have to let go of a few things here. We have to let go of this notion that for Apple to win Microsoft has to lose. OK? We have to embrace a notion that for Apple to win Apple has to do a really good job, and if others are going to help us, that’s great, cause we need all the help we can get. And if we screw up and we don’t do a good job, it’s not somebody else’s fault. It’s our fault. So, I think that’s a very important perspective.</p>
<p>  I think, if we want Microsoft Office on the Mac, we better treat the company that puts it out with a little bit of gratitude. We like their software. So, the era of setting this up as a competition between Apple and Microsoft is over as far as I’m concerned. This is about getting healthy, and this is about Apple being able to make incredibly great contributions to the industry, to get healthy and prosper again.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s Shein:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  But as the group runs into adaptive difficulties, as its environment changes to the point where some of its assumptions are no longer valid, leadership comes into play once more. Leadership is now the ability to step outside the culture that created the leader and to start evolutionary change processes that are more adaptive. This ability to perceive the limitations of one’s own culture and to evolve the culture adaptively is the essence and ultimate challenge of leadership.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Make no mistake: even though he had been gone for over a decade, Steve Jobs was responsible for that booing.</p>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jobsibm121230-1.jpg"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jobsibm121230-1.jpg" alt="jobsibm121230-1" width="600" height="620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2150" /></a></p>
<p>Jobs had set up Apple generally and the Macintosh specifically as completely unique and superior to the alternatives, particularly the hated IBM PC and its Windows (originally DOS) operating system. By 1997, though, Microsoft had won, and Apple was fighting for its life. And yet the audience booed its lifeline! That is how powerful culture can be — and that is why Jobs&#8217; &#8220;impromptu sermon&#8221; was so necessary and so powerful. It was Apple&#8217;s version of Office on the iPad, and a brilliant display of leadership.</p>
<h4>Warning Signs for Apple and Google</h4>
<p>Over the weekend Marco Arment wrote a widely-read piece (now) called <a href="https://marco.org/2016/05/21/avoiding-blackberrys-fate">If Google’s Right About AI, That’s a Problem for Apple</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The BlackBerry’s success came to an end not because RIM started releasing worse smartphones, but because the new job of the smartphone shifted almost entirely outside of their capabilities, and it was too late to catch up. RIM hadn’t spent years building a world-class operating system, or a staff full of great designers, or expertise in mass production of luxury-quality consumer electronics, or amazing APIs and developer tools, or an app store with millions of users with credit cards already on file, or all of the other major assets that Apple had developed over a decade (or longer) that enabled the iPhone. No new initiative, management change, or acquisition in 2007 could’ve saved the BlackBerry. It was too late, and the gulf was too wide.</p>
<p>  Today, Amazon, Facebook, and Google are placing large bets on advanced AI, ubiquitous assistants, and voice interfaces, hoping that these will become the next thing that our devices are for. If they’re right — and that’s a big “if” — I’m worried for Apple…If the landscape shifts to prioritize those big-data AI services, Apple will find itself in a similar position as BlackBerry did almost a decade ago: what they’re able to do, despite being very good at it, won’t be enough anymore, and they won’t be able to catch up.

<p>Arment is exactly right. What is fascinating, though, is that, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/googles-go-to-market-gap/">as I wrote last week</a>, Google has their own set of problems: users actually spend their time in social apps, mostly owned by Facebook, and while Google has a critical asset in Android, its most valuable users (from a monetization standpoint) are on iOS. How will users actually access Google&#8217;s AI capabilities (if they turn out to matter), and how will Google monetize them?</p>
<p>To be sure, neither company is struggling today. Apple <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/apples-run-apples-earnings-iphone-upgrade-cycle-iphone-china/">may have failed to achieve record results</a> for the first time in 13 years, but their 2Q 2016 revenue of $50.6 billion was more than the revenue of Microsoft, Google, and Facebook combined; Google, meanwhile, is still setting year-over-year records, with $17.3 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>That, though, is the challenge: BlackBerry wasn&#8217;t struggling in 2006, nor was Microsoft in 2007, or even Apple as late as 1993. There was no obvious reason to think that anything was amiss, and it was culture that ensured that whatever hints there were would be ignored. Shein again:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Culture as a set of basic assumptions defines for us what to pay attention to, what things mean, how to react emotionally to what is going on, and what actions to take in various kinds of situations. Once we have developed an integrated set of such assumptions—a “thought world” or “mental map”—we will be maximally comfortable with others who share the same set of assumptions and very uncomfortable and vulnerable in situations where different assumptions operate, because either we will not understand what is going on, or, worse, we will misperceive and misinterpret the actions of others.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And so BlackBerry <a href="http://www.macnn.com/articles/10/12/27/rim.thought.apple.was.lying.on.iphone.in.2007/">thought Apple was lying</a> about the iPhone; Steve Ballmer declared &#8220;He liked Microsoft&#8217;s chances&#8221;; and Apple, well, Apple had already decided to, in Jobs&#8217; view, sacrifice product for profits. The time to act was at the moment of denial, not the moment of crisis.</p>
<h4>Paths Forward</h4>
<p>That said, both Apple and Google are still operating from positions of considerable strength going forward: iPhone growth <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/2129/">may or may not have peaked</a>, but it&#8217;s not going anywhere for a good long while, and the company is almost certainly <a href="http://www.aboveavalon.com/notes/2016/5/11/apple-rd-reveals-a-pivot-is-coming">working on a car</a>. Google, meanwhile, is arguably in even better shape: the company has a massive lead in machine learning, which could manifest itself in all kinds of interesting applications, and here Android looms large.</p>
<p>Still, there are very obvious steps both companies could do to entrench their advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple could partner with a company like Microsoft (again) to build out its services layer, both on the backend (Azure) and, if they want to get really radical, the front-end (combining Siri and Cortana). The most radical solution, though, would be fully opening up iOS in such a way that users could set Google (or any other company&#8217;s) services as defaults. This would foreclose any medium-term threat to the iPhone from an Android experience that is fully-infused with Google&#8217;s AI capabilities (more on the long-term problems in a moment)</li>
<li>Google could — should! — build a bot for Facebook Messenger. More than that, they should build an entire backend for Facebook Messenger developers. Do people want to live in Facebook? Very well, meet them there, just as Google found its user base on Windows through the browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both ideas (and there are certainly others) have their issues: Apple would be foreclosing their future as a services provider, but frankly, I am extremely skeptical about this regardless. Not only does the company have the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/apples-organizational-crossroads/">wrong organizational structure</a> but, similar to Microsoft, the company&#8217;s overwhelming success has had far-reaching effects on the culture; in this case, the company is so focused on making physical products that it&#8217;s doubtful an effective services mentality could ever emerge, not to mention the company&#8217;s (at times disingenuous) <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/tim-cooks-unfair-and-unrealistic-privacy-speech-strategy-credits-the-privacy-priority-problem/">absolutism about privacy</a>.<sup><a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-curse-of-culture/#footnote_1_2149" id="identifier_1_2149" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This too is why I don&rsquo;t buy the &ldquo;Wait for WWDC&rdquo; response to Marco&rsquo;s article; the reasons to be skeptical about Apple&rsquo;s prospects here are structural">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Google, meanwhile, would be supporting its most dangerous competitor. At the end of the day Google and Facebook share the exact same customers — advertisers — and even though it&#8217;s not clear how Google can steal attention back it&#8217;s also not obvious that they should aid their rival.<sup><a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-curse-of-culture/#footnote_2_2149" id="identifier_2_2149" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="That, in some respects, gets to the tragedy of this piece: Apple and Google are the most natural of partners. Neither has to lose for the other to win, and both have wasted far too much valuable time fighting a war that was never necessary.">3</a></sup></p>
<h4>The Curse of Culture</h4>
<p>The biggest problem for both, though, is culture. Apple, beyond everything else — and in part because of <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/why-doesnt-apple-enable-sustainable-businesses-on-the-app-store/">the humiliation of that 1997 keynote</a> — desires complete control; Google, for its part, desires information, and can&#8217;t tolerate the idea of Facebook having more.</p>
<p>The rigidity of both is the manifestation of the disease that affects every great company: the assurance that what worked before will work eternally into the future, even if circumstances have changed. What makes companies great is inevitably what makes companies fail, whenever that day comes.<sup><a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-curse-of-culture/#footnote_3_2149" id="identifier_3_2149" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="One final quote from Shein:

  If one wishes to distinguish leadership from management or administration, one can argue that leadership creates and changes cultures, while management and administration act within a culture. By defining leadership in this manner, I am not implying that culture is easy to create or change, or that formal leaders are the only determiners of culture. On the contrary, as we will see, culture refers to those elements of a group or organization that are most stable and least malleable. Culture is the result of a complex group learning process that is only partially influenced by leader behavior. But if the group&rsquo;s survival is threatened because elements of its culture have become maladapted, it is ultimately the function of leadership at all levels of the organization to recognize and do something about this situation. It is in this sense that leadership and culture are conceptually intertwined.
