				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Wait But Hi: A Global In-Person Hangout for the WBW Community</strong></p>
<p>A typical internet rule is that internet comment sections are upsetting places. Comment sections are full of not-very-interesting people being not very nice to other not-very-interesting people for hours on end while the world dies.</p>
<p>But Wait But Why has proven to be an exception. Somehow, the world’s low-quality people seem to have not discovered this blog. Or maybe they have and they just never get to the bottom of the long articles. We’re not sure how it happened, but Wait But Why readers are the best. They’re smart and curious and thinky and un-dickish and they don’t take themselves that seriously. And if there’s one thing the Wait But Why community has made clear to us in their comments and emails, it’s that they want to hang out with each other in a place more fun than Disqus. We agree.</p>
<p>So it’s time.</p>
<p><strong>I’m excited to announce the very first ever Wait But Hi.</strong></p>
<p>That’s right. Wait But Hi.</p>
<p>Wait But Hi will be a huge global hangout day on Saturday, August 13, 2016. Here’s how it’s gonna work:</p>
<p>1) If you want to participate in Wait But Hi, fill out the survey below, which takes about 15 minutes (and must be done in one sitting). This will tell us about who you are, who you like, and what kind of things are fun for you.</p>
<p>2) Over the next month, the WBW team will use the survey results to carefully match up groups of people, organizing hundreds of group hangouts all over the world.</p>
<p>3) On August 13, you’ll be instructed where and when to go, and only when you get there will you find out what we’ve planned for you—customized to you—based on what we’ve learned about you from the survey. You might find yourself making homemade pasta with eight other WBW readers at one of their homes. You might end up in a group of five somewhere, rock climbing. You might be getting drunk with people and playing mafia. You might be with a group getting a lesson in knitting from a pro-knitting WBW reader or a lesson in quantum computing from a WBW reader physicist. If your survey tells us you’re single, you might be headed to a haunted house on a one-on-one date, as part of our dream of creating a Wait But Why baby. There are no rules.</p>
<p>We don’t know what the fuck we’re doing, but we’re very excited about it.</p>
<p>Whatever we plan for you on August 13, our goal is for it to be fun. Not “something that is a fun story later and you’re happy you did it but while it was actually happening you were kind of miserable” fun, but actually really fun, where you’re sorry when it’s over. We think we’ll learn enough about you from your survey to pull that off.</p>
<p>So whoever you are, wherever you are in the world, we hope you’ll jump in with us and do Wait But Hi—an event for the whole WBW community, all happening simultaneously, all over the world.</p>
<p><strong>Important notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can take the survey down below. It takes about 15 minutes, <u>you have to take it in a single sitting</u>, and <strong>you have to take it by the end of Wednesday, July 13 (EDT).</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not everyone who takes the survey will get to do Wait But Hi.</strong> Part of what’s cool about this is that we’re carefully customizing every single hangout to the specific people involved, but that also means that we probably can’t accommodate everybody. We’ll be giving first priority to our Patreon donors, second priority to our email subscribers (we’ll know if you’re one of these people by your email address), and third priority to everyone else—but we’ll be including some people from all three groups.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Wait But Hi is not-for-profit on our end and <em>just </em>about free on yours. There will be a $5 admin fee for everyone who participates (you won’t be asked for this payment until you’ve been selected to participate), and other than that, all you’ll need to pay is for your share of whatever your group activity is. And how expensive it’ll be on the day is up to you—one of the questions in the survey is about your budget, and we plan to create different hangouts for people of all different budgets.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finally, since not everyone will be able to participate, there is a second part of Wait But Hi for everyone: A number of large hangouts in major cities (in places like Central Park) the next day—Sunday, August 14. </strong>More info on that later.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Welcome to a third-degree avoidance mini-post! More on that <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/05/post-progress-meter.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p>I have a new word for you. Cluey. Let me explain.</p>
<p>My father once told me a mundane little anecdote from his youth. It involved his father—my late grandfather—and one of the happiest and most loving people I&#8217;ve ever known.</p>
<p>One weekend day, my grandfather went to the store and brought a new board game home for the family: Clue.</p>
<p>He excitedly asked my father and his sister (who were 7 and 9 at the time) if they wanted to play. They did. They joined him at the kitchen table as he opened up the game, read the instructions and explained to them how to play, divided up the cards and put all the pieces where they go.</p>
<p>Just as they were about to start, the doorbell rang. It was the neighbor kids, who said they were on their way outside to play some outdoor game they all used to play. Without a second thought, my dad and aunt jumped up from their seats and left with their friends.</p>
<p>A few hours later, they came back to the house. The game had been put back in the closet.</p>
<p>At the time, my dad didn&#8217;t think much of it—pretty normal day in their lives. But later on, he found himself remembering that day, and he always felt bad about it. He pictured his father sitting there at the table, now alone, with all the cards and pieces laid out. He pictured him waiting for a little while before accepting that it wasn&#8217;t gonna happen today, then collecting all the pieces and cards he had laid out, putting them back in the box, and putting the box back in the closet.</p>
<p>Pretty random story for my dad to tell me, right? The reason he did was because it was part of a conversation where I was trying to articulate a certain thing I suffer from, which is feeling <em>incredibly </em>bad for certain people in certain situations—situations in which the person I feel bad for was probably barely affected by what happened. It&#8217;s an odd feeling of intense heartbreaking compassion for people who didn&#8217;t actually go through anything especially bad.</p>
<p>When I explained this, my dad said, &#8220;I know what you&#8217;re talking about,&#8221; and offered up the Clue story. Devastating. My grandfather had been <em>excited </em>about playing, and he was being such a <em>good, loving </em>dad, and he ended up <em>let down and disappointed</em>. He sat there <em>all by himself with the game board</em>, and finally he <em>put all the cards and pieces back in the box </em>because no, the game wasn&#8217;t happening anymore because <em>his kids would rather play with their friends than him. </em></p>
<p>My grandfather fought in World War II. He probably lost friends. He probably shot people. He might have been shot himself, who knows. But the image of him quietly putting all the Clue pieces back in the box? That&#8217;s not fucking okay. And now, thanks to my dad sharing this memory, I live every day haunted by this image:</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Clueyness-1.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5256" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Clueyness-1.png" alt="Stick figure putting Clue box back in the closet - clueyness" width="750" height="509" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Clueyness-1.png 1253w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Clueyness-1-300x204.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Clueyness-1-768x521.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Clueyness-1-600x407.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Clueyness-1-782x530.png 782w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Clueyness-1-345x234.png 345w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Clueyness-1-103x70.png 103w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just my dad doing this to me. Tell me how I&#8217;m supposed to handle <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemcneal/paw-paw-why?utm_term=.xfn5KdaKx#.piQP9aK9q" target="_blank">this fucking story</a>, where <em>the grandfather made 12 burgers for six grandkids and only one showed up. </em></p>
<p>Full Clue situation. And the story includes literally the clueiest picture I&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-30-at-3.07.05-PM.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5243" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-30-at-3.07.05-PM.png" alt="papaw eating a hamburger alone" width="400" height="427" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-30-at-3.07.05-PM.png 990w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-30-at-3.07.05-PM-281x300.png 281w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-30-at-3.07.05-PM-768x821.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-30-at-3.07.05-PM-561x600.png 561w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>As I read the story, I started picturing this NICE FUCKING MAN buying all the ingredients in the grocery store, in a good mood with anticipation for the night, then coming home and making each of the 12 patties by hand—<em>maybe even adding carefully-thought-out spices into</em> <em>them</em>—toasting the buns, and timing everything to be done at just the right time. He even made <em>homemade ice cream.</em> Clue up the <em>dick</em>. It continues, if you imagine what happened at the end of the night. Either he wrapped up eight uneaten burgers, one by one, and put them in the fridge, ensuring that he&#8217;s later reminded of the rejection each time he heats one up to eat it, or, even worse, he just <em>threw them in the trash</em>.</p>
<p>The only thing that prevented me from taking my own life while reading the story is that the one granddaughter—bless her soul—showed up. Because just <em>imagine</em>.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/lol/sad-papaw-ii-grandma-alone-art-show/" target="_blank">this 89-year-old grandmother</a>, who got <em><a href="https://twitter.com/Hablasian/status/728398280376258561/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">dressed nicely</a></em> and put her paintings up for display at an art showing, and guess what? No one fucking came. Then she packed up her paintings and drove home, feeling &#8220;foolish.&#8221; You know what that is? It&#8217;s cluey as shit. <em>Especially </em>her choice of the word foolish in particular. I really don&#8217;t need this in my life.</p>
<p>Movies know all about clueyness and use it to their advantage. Remember that super cluey old man neighbor in <em>Home Alone? </em>Who was so <em>nice and lonely and misunderstood? </em>The writers literally invented him to inflict clueyness on the audience so they could then release the burden of that clueyness at the end by showing him in happy reunion with his family. Cheapest trick in the book.</p>
<p>Clueyness doesn&#8217;t only apply to old people. One time about five years ago, I was in a shitty mood and in a rush when I hastily walked out of my apartment building. A FedEx man was standing outside the building with his cart of packages, and he wanted to get in so he could leave the packages on top of the communal mailbox (I assume the package recipient wasn&#8217;t home, so he had had no luck being buzzed in). As I walked out, he reached for the door as it closed behind me but it shut before he could grab it. After the door re-locked, he let out a frustrated exhale, and then he turned to me and asked, &#8220;Can you please open the door so I can drop these off?&#8221; I was already 10 steps away though, and late, so I said, &#8220;Sorry I can&#8217;t right now&#8221; and turned back towards where I was going. Before I did, I briefly saw his reaction to my refusal to help. He had the face on of a nice person who the world had been mean to all day. The snapshot of that dejected face he made bothered me more and more throughout the day, and now it&#8217;s five years later and <em>I still think about it. </em></p>
<p>If someone asks me what my biggest regret is, I have to lie, because how weird would it be if I answered, &#8220;The FedEx man incident. I&#8217;m a monster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clueyness is a strange phenomenon. My grandfather probably forgot about the Clue incident an hour after it happened. The FedEx man probably forgot about what I did to him five minutes later. I literally got cluey about a <em>dog </em>the other day, when he was super excited to play and I was busy and nudged him away with my foot and he looked at me <em>confused and taken aback</em><em> </em>and then went to the side of the room and laid down—and dogs aren&#8217;t even real. The weight of my heartache in these cases outweighs the actual tragedy like 10,000:1.</p>
<p>But knowing that it&#8217;s totally irrational doesn&#8217;t make clueyness any less excruciating—something I&#8217;m reminded of every time my night is ruined by post-Uber-ride-when-the-friendly-driver-tried-to-start-a-conversation-and-I-wasn&#8217;t-in-the-mood-so-I-gave-curt-answers-until-he-finally-got-the-hint-and-then-felt-embarrassed-and-stopped guilt.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just destined for a life of feeling cluey about things. But at least I can take solace in a little headline I came across recently:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to a new Wait But Why thing: the mailbag.</p>
<p>I get a lot of email from readers asking great questions, and there’s just not time to give most of them a proper answer. Unless, of course, I do a full post dedicated to those questions. So that’s what this is.</p>
<p>When the last post went out, I asked <a data-sumome-listbuilder-id="4171d68e-76b7-4053-afde-d702db0d891c">our email subscribers</a> to submit mailbag questions, and a lot of you responded. I can group the responses that came in into two categories:</p>
<p>1) Questions whose answers would be somewhere between one sentence and a few paragraphs</p>
<p>2) Questions whose answers would be somewhere between a few paragraphs and 30,000 words</p>
<p>The latter went into my Potential Future Posts List. The former were perfect for the mailbag.</p>
<p>For this mailbag, I started with 46 questions and saved the rest for future mailbags. Moving forward, you can submit a mailbag question anytime to <a href="mailto:mailbag@waitbutwhy.com">mailbag@waitbutwhy.com</a>.</p>
<p>Okay let&#8217;s jump in—</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Smooth or crunchy peanut butter?</strong></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> – <em>James T. (Adelaide, Australia)</em></span></p>
<p>Smooth. I have a jar of peanut butter and sometimes I take a big spoon of it and eat it, and the next 45 seconds of my life is chaotic and upsetting. Crunchy adds another factor on top of that situation, which is the last thing I need.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>What do you think about <em>The Martian</em>? Do you like the book or movie better?</strong> </span>– <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Scott R. (Richmond, VA)</em></span></p>
<p>Book for sure. The movie was solid and enjoyable, but kind of just another pretty good movie. The book was special. It was one giant thought experiment that explored, “What would happen if a super-smart astronaut got stranded on Mars?” and you got the answer to the experiment told through the detailed, inner thoughts of the astronaut. I loved how many technical explanations there were in the book as Watney puzzled his way through problems, and the movie lost 90% of that aspect. In fairness, I read the book first and had no idea what was gonna happen, and I watched the movie without that suspense, so I’m not a fully fair judge.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>What do you believe that not many other people do? (i.e., what are some of your unpopular opinions?)</strong></span> – <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Jeremiah O. (New York, NY)</em></span></p>
<p>Saying you’re purely pro-life or purely pro-choice are both inane, for different reasons. A post on this is high up in the queue, so not gonna expand here. But that’s what I think.</p>
<p>Being inside is better than being outside in not all but most cases.</p>
<p>The longer the plane ride, the better. Plane rides are the best—as long as I don&#8217;t have to work or have to sleep.</p>
<p>Great music without lyrics is better than great music with lyrics.</p>
<p>Black licorice is delicious.</p>
<p>Chocolate is a bad flavor of ice cream.</p>
<p>Animated TV or movies are more fun to watch than real people TV or movies.</p>
<p>Washing your hair every day is a silly thing to do.</p>
<p>Ordering fish in a restaurant is for people who don&#8217;t care about happiness.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Would you call yourself a transhumanist? </span></strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">– </span></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Saurabh S. (New Delhi, India)</em></span></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure what a transhumanist is. Hold on.</p>
<p>Okay Wikipedia says it’s this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Transhumanism is an international and intellectual movement that aims to transform the human condition by developing and creating widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities. Transhumanist thinkers study the potential benefits and dangers of emerging technologies that could overcome fundamental human limitations, as well as the ethics of using such technologies. The most common thesis is that human beings may eventually be able to transform themselves into different beings with abilities so greatly expanded from the natural condition as to merit the label of posthuman beings.</em></p>
<p>Uh, yeah, definitely. The objectives of transhumanism strike me as the kind of thing a lot of people think is wrong or distasteful or unnatural&#8230;until it becomes commonplace. And then people can&#8217;t imagine what life was like before and would <em>never </em>want to go back.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m always in favor of getting rid of what&#8217;s &#8220;natural&#8221; for something that&#8217;s better. Sleeping in caves is natural, and it&#8217;s really great that we found a better way. Riding horses is how humans got around for a long time, and driving cars is a huge upgrade for both the human and the horse. I&#8217;m sure people thought the concept of the organ transplant was terribly unnatural before the technology became possible, and now they don&#8217;t. So yeah, let&#8217;s go for it. I&#8217;m not at all attached to the biological body I was born with if we can find a better way.</p>
<p>That said, at some point you start running into the question <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/what-makes-you-you.html" target="_blank">&#8220;what makes you you?&#8221;</a> I&#8217;ll upgrade any part of my existence in any way available until it gets to the point where doing so kills me by making me not me anymore. If science can replace my brain with a synthetic brain containing the identical data as my own, with the advantage that it&#8217;ll never age, it sounds great—unless I suspect that the new me seems like me and acts like me but <em>I </em>don&#8217;t actually have access to that consciousness. When an upgrade gets to the point where it&#8217;s essentially creating a synthetic clone of me to take my place in the world—that&#8217;s right where my transhumanism ends. The exception might be if I was going to die either way and creating the upgraded no-longer-me clone me can serve people on Earth somehow, like someone creating a clone of themselves so their family doesn&#8217;t have to lose them.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t know when an upgrade causes you to cease to exist because there&#8217;s no clear answer to what makes you you. But we&#8217;re a long way from crossing that bridge, so for now, I&#8217;m pro-transhumanism.</p>

<p>No. But I do know BC Calculus, thank god, because the American public school curriculum was last updated in 1820.</p>
<p>Part of me thinks it&#8217;s a no-brainer time investment to learn to code, but part of me also wonders if we might be in a phase of time when it&#8217;s an important skill to have, but then that phase ends. There was a time when it was important for computer people to know how to actually use 1&#8217;s and 0&#8217;s and now there&#8217;s no need for that, so maybe people who are being born now will never need to learn how to code? I&#8217;d prefer that narrative, because it would mean A) it excuses me from having to deal with learning how to code, and B) I only made a dramatic two-decade mistake by not learning how to code in college and not a lifelong one.</p>
<p>I should probably learn how to code.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Why did you decide to buy a tortoise?</span> </strong>– <em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Samantha K. (Singapore)</span></em></p>
<p>In 2005, I went to the pet store to get a fighter fish because why not have a little screensaver on your desk. When I got there, I walked by a glass terrarium with a golf-ball-sized tortoise in it. I asked to hold him immediately, lifting him up by pinching his shell between my thumb and index finger. His four legs moved back and forth as he tried to figure out why he was suddenly levitating in mid-air. And the decision was done.</p>
<p>11 years later, Winston and I live happily together. As I type this, he (now the size of a football) is moseying by me, going about his business, living his life.</p>
<p>I’m not really sure why everyone doesn’t own a tortoise. They’re hilarious entities, they’re unthinkably cute, they’re unbelievably chill and require very little from you, they’re a great party trick when you have friends over, and they won’t expire until your grandkids are in their 80s.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">What would you do if you could meet antimatter Tim?</span> </strong>– <em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Treyvon C. (Houston, TX)</span></em></p>
<p>Thanks, Treyvon, for sending me on an hour spiral reading about antimatter and what happens when you combine it with matter.</p>
<p>Here’s the deal. Antimatter is matter made up of antiparticles, which are like normal particles except with the opposite charge—negatively charged protons, positively charged electrons, etc.</p>
<p>Antimatter occurs very rarely in nature and is incredibly hard to produce—so hard that in 1999, NASA <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/1999/prop12apr99_1/" target="_blank">estimated</a> that the going rate for antimatter was about $62.5 trillion per gram. A later <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/home/antimatter_spaceship.html" target="_blank">estimate</a> in 2006 brought the price down to only $25 billion a gram nbd.</p>
<p>I weigh about 160 lbs or about 73 kg. So at the cheapest, anti-matter Tim would be worth about $1,825,000,000,000,000 and would be getting mugged constantly.</p>
<p>But if he managed to make it intact to a meeting with me, it would be fun to meet him until we shook hands and the Earth blew up.</p>
<p>Here’s the problem: when matter and antimatter are put together, both of them are annihilated and a lot of energy is released. How much energy? E = mc<sup>2</sup><sub>  </sub>much. That example—a gram of antimatter and a gram of matter colliding—comes out like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">E = mc<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Mass = 2 grams in this case, and c = the speed of light in meters/second = about 300,000,000 m/s, so:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">E = (.002 kg)(300,000,000)<sup>2</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">E = 1.8 x 10<sup>14</sup><sub>  </sub>joules</p>
<p>1 kg of TNT releases 4,184,000 joules of energy. So our gram of antimatter collision produces an explosion equivalent to blowing up about 43 million kg of TNT.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">= 43,000 tons of TNT<br />
= 43 kilotons of TNT<br />
= an explosion about three times bigger than the Hiroshima bomb</p>
<p>And that’s a <em>gram </em>of antimatter.</p>
<p>Back to my hangout with antimatter Tim. He and I each weigh about 73,000 grams, so our handshake would be unpleasant for both of us, blowing us both up in an explosion that releases the same energy as 3.1 million kilotons, or 3,100 <em>mega</em>tons of TNT. (A megaton = a million tons = a billion kgs)</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinitrotoluene" target="_blank">density of TNT</a> is 1.654 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. So a kg of TNT would be about the size of a grapefruit, a ton of TNT would be a little smaller than a car, a kiloton of TNT would be the size of a house, and my handshake with antimatter Tim would be like blowing up a cube of TNT with a side of 1.2 km. Very similar, it turns out, to what I <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/03/7-3-billion-people-one-building.html" target="_blank">once figured out</a> was the size of the building needed to hold all the world’s humans:</p>

<p>It wouldn’t quite blow up the Earth, but with an explosion 200,000 times the size of the Hiroshima bomb, me meeting antimatter Tim would be bad for everybody.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Do you have any insights as to how one finds their calling?</strong></span> – <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Akshat V. (Bangalore, India)</em></span></p>
<p>Say two people want to find the love of their life, Person A and Person B.</p>
<p>Person A never goes on dates, opting instead to sit alone debating in her head about who the exact kind of person is she will fall in love with. She scours online profiles, but never contacts anyone. Instead, her plan is to wait until she comes across the profile so perfect for her that she’ll know she’s found The One. Then and only then will she reach out to that person for a date.</p>
<p>Person B goes on a lot of dates, constantly meeting new people and keeping an open mind, because she knows she probably doesn’t know either herself or the type of match that makes sense for her as well as she thinks she does.</p>
<p>Who’s more likely to find the love of their life?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Can you suggest [legal] ways to experience Whoa moments?</strong> </span>– <em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Tóth B.</span></em></p>
<p>Psychedelic methods aside, I’d say this:</p>
<p>The best way <em>not</em> to experience a <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html" target="_blank">whoa moment</a> is to live your days exactly how you normally do. You know how when you brush your teeth, you can think about something totally different and it doesn’t affect your ability to brush? Because it’s all being done by your subconscious? Well living your normal routine day is kind of like that—your brain is mostly on autopilot, and you&#8217;re living largely in an unconscious and comfortable groove.</p>
<p>To bring heightened clarity and new epiphanies into your life, try getting out of that unconscious groove by forcing conscious thought about things our consciousness doesn&#8217;t usually bother with because they&#8217;re not important for our daily tasks. I did this recently when I found myself with 15 minutes to kill on a street corner before meeting someone there. Instead of doing what I&#8217;d normally do—burying myself in my phone to pass the time—I decided to get into &#8220;conscious mode.&#8221; I looked up and around me at the architecture, I looked at little details on the sidewalk and the steps of a nearby building, I looked down at my feet and realized it was funny that I was supporting myself vertically on two sticks. And suddenly, everything was weird, and I was having a great time. It was hilarious watching all these people bustling around, all of them on their own two sticks, all of them stuck to the side of a floating rock in space, and none of them thinking about that. Full whoa moment.</p>
<p>But the people I was watching weren&#8217;t thinking about being stuck to the side of a rock floating in a huge void—they were completely lost in the unconscious groove we all spend most of our time in.</p>
<p>A whoa moment happens when your conscious mind takes a step back and glimpses reality for a second, which we all have the power to do—we just have to remember to think about it.</p>

<p>Funny you ask. I’m going this year for the first time—at least that’s the plan (I’ve failed so far at getting tickets). I’ve heard about Burning Man a lot, but it always struck me as something very not me-ish to go to. Without really knowing what Burning Man is, I&#8217;ve always just pictured a bunch of people standing in the 120º desert acting exactly like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad3TwRtPvfU" target="_blank">this woman</a>, except with no stage or music nearby. And what the hell am I gonna do in that situation. Also very unclear why that video has so many views.</p>
<p>But over the past few years, I’ve heard so many people say so many fascinating things about it that I&#8217;ve become enticed enough to give it a try. Any advice from Burning Man veterans is welcome.</p>

<p>I said a lot of words. I actually made what I now realize was the world’s first podcast in 1987 when I was five. I had this little tape-player/recorder and I’d regularly put a blank tape in and press record and say some shit for a half hour. Then I’d write “Tim’s Performance” on the tape and give it to my parents to enjoy. At one point, I suspected they were lying about actually listening to my musings, so I tested them by waiting until about 20 minutes into one of my recording sessions and then saying, “The secret number is 128. I’m going to ask you what the secret number is later, and remember, it’s 128.” I later asked my parents what the secret number was and they didn’t know what the fuck I was talking about. My podcast was not engaging.</p>

<p>For those unacquainted, I believe Will is referring to the fact that I started Wait But Why 100% sure I was going to die somewhere between 2013 and 2100, and then I wrote posts like the <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html" target="_blank">Fermi</a> post and the <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html" target="_blank">AI</a> post and the <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html" target="_blank">Truthism</a> post and the <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/cryonics.html" target="_blank">Cryonics</a> post and now I have no idea what the fuck is going on. Suddenly, the prospect of living till I’m an ultra-cranky 1,280-year-old seems perfectly plausible.</p>
<p>I’m not sure my life purpose has changed because I’m not sure I had a life purpose in mind to begin with. But it’s definitely put me in a better mood about things. An atheist is already at rock bottom when it comes to their personal long-term outlook, so realizing that the world of 2050 might be unrecognizable to us, with totally different rules, is a delightful development.</p>

</strong></span><strong>As one of the many (I&#8217;m assuming here) people out there who read snippets of your posts to an unreceptive spouse, I&#8217;m wondering if there are clusters of Myers &amp; Briggs personality types that find your writing particularly appealing. So, I would really enjoy the following: (1)</strong><strong> Your MBTI results, (2) The results of a survey of your email subscribers, and (3) Your thoughts on the whole thing.</strong> – <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Preston S. (Oklahoma City, OK)</em></span></p>
<p>For those unacquainted, Myers Briggs is a famous personality test that labels everyone with a four-letter code. It judges personalities on a set of four binary criteria. As explained by the <a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/" target="_blank">Myers Briggs website</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><u>Favorite world</u></em><em>: Do you prefer to focus on the outer world or on your own inner world? This is called <strong>Extraversion (E)</strong> or<strong> Introversion (I)</strong>.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><u>Information</u></em><em>: Do you prefer to focus on the basic information you take in or do you prefer to interpret and add meaning? This is called <strong>Sensing (S)</strong> or <strong>Intuition (N)</strong>.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><u>Decisions</u></em><em>: When making decisions, do you prefer to first look at logic and consistency or first look at the people and special circumstances? This is called <strong>Thinking (T)</strong> or <strong>Feeling (F)</strong>.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><u>Structure</u></em><em>: In dealing with the outside world, do you prefer to get things decided or do you prefer to stay open to new information and options? This is called <strong>Judging (J)</strong> or <strong>Perceiving (P)</strong>.</em></p>
<p>So one person might be an ENFP while another person might be an ISFJ, and so on. Myers Briggs also lays out the typical characteristics of each of the 16 possible types <a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/the-16-mbti-types.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>The whole thing seems a little simplistic to me, given how complicated and multi-dimensional humans are. But it’s still fun.</p>
<p>When I took the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test" target="_blank">test</a>, I got an INTP. I was close to the I/E border and the S/N border, while very strongly a T and a P.</p>
<p>Preston also asked about doing a survey of email subscribers. Let’s just put a survey <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/wbw-mbti" target="_blank">here</a>. We’ll publish the results on the WBW Facebook page.</p>

<p>If I take a step back and look at this from first principles, I start by looking up whether the procedure is important for health reasons. When I find out the answer is probably not, it becomes pretty clear that circumcision is nothing other than a primitive, religious practice of genital mutilation that for some reason is common today. It makes no sense, and once we all stop doing it, it’ll seem like an absurd custom of the past. I had friends recently go through this decision with their new baby, and every argument went against circumcision except one: not circumsizing their son would make him different than most of the other guys in his world in a part of life where being different can be mortifying, especially as either a little kid being made fun of by his friends or an already-sexually-insecure teenager. They went with circumcision. And I get it. But it makes no sense, aside from the fact that we’re all doing it (at least in the US). Can we just all agree to stop it with new babies?</p>

<p>As I thought about the answer to this question, I realized that the movies I’ve liked the absolute most in my life were movies made for 7-10-year olds when I was 7-10. The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Home Alone, The Princess Bride, Back to the Future, etc. Are those movies all incredible, or does this just always happen with whatever happened to be the best movies of your childhood? Not really sure.</p>
<p>For movies I’ve seen from the age of 10 onwards, I’ll give some awards:</p>
<p><strong>Most obvious answer that’s also just really good though: </strong>The Shawshank Redemption (Runners-up: Godfather 1/2, Braveheart)</p>
<p><strong>Less obvious answer that should be more obvious and I’m not sure why it’s not everyone’s favorite movie: </strong>Shutter Island</p>
<p><strong>Movie that is considered good but I probably liked it more than most people cause it was exactly my type of fun plot: </strong>Memento</p>
<p><strong>Movie that’s pretty random to put on this list but I just really liked it:</strong> About Schmidt</p>
<p><strong>Movie I thought was only pretty good but then it stuck with me way more than I realized it would and sometimes makes me wonder if I’m Truman and this thing is happening to me and having me seeing <em>The Truman Show </em>was a really intense, fun part of the plot for everyone watching: </strong>The Truman Show</p>
<p><strong>Most fun movie-watching experience even though I wouldn’t really call it a great movie: </strong>Ocean’s 11 (Runner-up: Limitless)</p>
<p><strong>Movie whose first 70% makes this list but not the last 30% because that part sucked: </strong>Minority Report</p>
<p><strong>Movie that I loved and took fully seriously and then saw again with people who were laughing the whole time and realized it was actually a comedy: </strong>Being John Malkovich. (Runner-up: American Psycho)</p>
<p><strong>Movie that’s not considered very good but I actually think it was great: </strong>The Invention of Lying</p>
<p><strong>Movie that might have been great but also it might have been terrible and I don’t know because I don’t know what the fuck happened: </strong>Mulholland Drive</p>
<p><strong>Documentary that was a terrible experience to watch the entire time but also the best documentary I’ve ever seen: </strong>Dear Zachary</p>
<p><strong>Documentary that was almost as good and it wasn&#8217;t a nightmare to watch: </strong>March of the Penguins</p>
<p><strong>Documentary that’s comforting as fuck to watch and I’ve seen it three times and there will be more viewings in the future: </strong>Jiro Dreams of Sushi</p>
<p><strong>Movie that I think about every time I see a person yelling things to no one on the street: </strong>Requiem for a Dream</p>
<p><strong>Movie that was incredibly good and also, kill me:</strong> Life is Beautiful</p>
<p><strong>Movie that is objectively pretty great but it also kind of annoys me how “cool” it is: </strong>Every Quentin Tarantino movie (Runner-up: Every Stanley Kubrik movie)</p>
<p><strong>Movie that ruined my happiness permanently: </strong>The Ring</p>
<p><strong>Movie that’s embarrassing to put on this list but sorry it was just really good: </strong>Love Actually. (Runner-up: Titanic)</p>
<p><strong>Worst movie I’ve ever seen:</strong> American Wedding. (Runner-up: From Hell. And Dodgeball. And Transformers 2. And Next Friday.)</p>
<p>One thing about this list is there are very few comedies. It’s not that I never like comedies—I just think comedy movies are rarely <em>that </em>funny. I can’t think of many movies that can equal the funniness of the funniest TV shows—shows like The Office (UK), Curb, It’s Always Sunny, Family Guy, etc.</p>
<p>As for what these say about me? I don’t really know—that&#8217;s for Joe to decide.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Has your curiosity ever been a problem for you?</strong></span> – <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Mariam C. (Paris, France)</em></span></p>
<p>My most prominent emotion when traveling in other countries (or in parts of the US I’m not used to) is curiosity. That’s part of why I often pick destinations that I don’t know much about or that seem super different from my world.</p>
<p>The most interesting experiences happen when I befriend locals, which usually allows me to get a much deeper glimpse into what life is like in that place than I ever could as a voyeuring tourist. I’ve gotten myself invited into homes, weddings, social events, factories, etc.—and it’s usually a great experience.</p>
<p>Usually.</p>
<p>On one of my solo trips, I was out in the Rio nightlife district of Lapa and met two extraordinarily friendly dudes. They really liked me, so much that they invited me to a nearby house party.</p>
<p>A random Brazilian house party! I had no idea what a Brazilian house party was like, and I was super excited to find out. Luckily for me, I had found two guys who just really like befriending random foreign dudes and bringing them to parties.</p>
<p>Then we went to the party, which turned out to be us standing on a silent street a few blocks away from the crowded area while they forcefully took my things and ran away. Interesting party, but they had a better time than I did.</p>
<p>Hilariously, I had taken a selfie with them earlier in the night when we were all still BFFs. It was on a disposable camera, and that was one of the things they decided not to bother taking, so I still have the picture.</p>

<p>Kind of funny looking at their faces and knowing now that the smiles were, “Oh god yes I think this guy’s actually gonna come with us!”</p>
<p>One other example that came to mind is the time I was about 12 and got curious about what would happen if I put my hamster, Waddles Urban, up my dad’s t-shirt when he was lying on his back on the couch sleeping. It was a very bad experience for both my dad and Waddles and a terrific one for me—kind of the reverse of the Brazil incident.</p>

Could anything ever prove the existence of God to you?</span> – </strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Michael S.</em><em> </em></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Why don&#8217;t you believe in God?</span> – </strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Luis C. (Dallas, TX)</em></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">How can you be 100% sure that there isn&#8217;t something deeper to life than the material realm?</span> – </strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Noli S. (Prishtina, Kosovo)</em></span><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to everything written in the Bible, Quran, Torah, Vedas, Guru Granth Sahib, and all the rest, I’m atheist for the same reason I’m atheist about Greek Myths when I read them—they were written by people a long time ago who knew less than we do about the world, not more. No, lightning isn’t caused by Zeus throwing lightning bolts, it&#8217;s caused by the interaction of oppositely-charged particles in heavy clouds. And no, ancient rocks and fossils and mountains and canyons weren’t created by a great flood 6,000 years ago, they were created by a bunch of other stuff that happened over the past five billion years—stuff that we now understand. So when it comes to the various gods described in the world’s religions—yes, I’m as atheist as can be. With those gods, the question isn’t “Why don’t I believe in God?” it’s “Why <em>would </em>I believe in God?”</p>
<p>That said, when it comes to the question, “Is there a higher force or higher being or grand creator of some kind?” I’m entirely agnostic. We don’t even know if we’re alone in the universe or not—as far as we know, there are trillions of superintelligent civilizations out there, with capabilities we couldn’t understand even if they tried to explain it to us (could you explain human capabilities to a chicken?). Could one of them have created life on Earth in some lab? Sure, why not?</p>
<p>Could it be that it’s common for higher civilizations to create simulations, and if so, wouldn’t that mean that they might create trillions upon trillions of them, and if so, wouldn’t that mean that there are far more simulation civilizations in existence than real ones, and if so, wouldn’t that mean that just by the percentages, it’s far more likely that we’re one of the simulated ones than one of the real ones? Uh…I guess yeah?<a href="#footnote2-1-5151" id="note2-1-5151" rel="footnote2">1</a>
<p>We don’t even know what the universe <em>is</em>. It might be one of hundreds or millions or an infinite number of universes, or it might be the only thing there is. It might be a blip of energy floating around in one of the quarks inside one of the atoms that makes up the toenail of a red and blue baby pig bathing himself in a five-dimensional jelly swamp, and it comes into and out of existence in a nanosecond of the piglet’s life since every second in his world is 10<sup><span style="font-size: 9pt;">10</span><sup><span style="font-size: 7pt;">925</span></sup></sup> years for us. That literally might be what’s happening. It’s as likely as anything else you can come up with.</p>
<p>So it’s outrageous to declare anything about the origin of life, the existence of one or more higher beings, or what our place is in all of this other than “I don’t know.” Agnostic.</p>
<p>And when any fellow human—in 2016 or in 100 A.D.—declares that he knows the deal with God, including a bunch of details, I immediately say “Nope.”</p>
<p>I think that answers Luis and Noli. As for Michael—the answer is yes. I know what I know because of the information I have. If new information presents itself to me, it might change what I believe. But even if some rad supernatural shit happened like some woman levitated on the sidewalk when I walked by and then suddenly went shooting upwards through the clouds, I’d be quicker to assume that it was the work of a biological or AI being from another part of the universe, or that we were in a simulation and the beings running it got bored and decided to fuck with me, than I would be to take what I saw as evidence that one of the Earthly religions was true.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Would you rather be attacked by 100 duck-sized horses or 1 horse-sized duck?</strong> </span>– <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Kyle P. (Cheshire, CT)</em></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time thinking about this.</p>
<p>I’d go for the 100 little horses. Here’s why:</p>
<p>The duck would be <em>terrifying</em>. Have you seen how ducks act when you throw a piece of bread in the water? They turn into ravenous psychos. They use their wings, beaks, feet, and anything else they can to violently knock the other ducks out of the way. Then they <em>lunge </em>at the bread with their big hard duck beak. Now imagine a huge duck and <em>you’re </em>the bread. You’re done. That cock will charge at you and try to bite your head off. And you can’t run away—because it can <em>fly</em>. And its beak is still narrow enough that if you try to hide somewhere it can probably wedge its beak in there and pull you out. You’re done. It’s over.</p>
<p>The horses would be bad. But not as bad as the duck. Angry horses are pretty angry. And their bite could probably take a chunk out of your leg. Or maybe they’d kick you with their hind legs, which would give you painful little ankle bruises. All of that would be painful, but not lethal. Lethal happens when you’re frantically kicking them one by one and you accidentally fall over. Falling over would be a huge disaster with the little horses. They’d be biting your neck open and kicking you in the crotch and jumping up on your stomach. Done. But unlike with the duck, you could probably escape the horses. You could just climb up on a bench and now what? They’re screwed. They can charge the bench and jump up on their hind legs all they want, but you’re a full foot above their highest jump, and they can’t climb or fly, so you can just lay down and nap on the bench while they tire themselves out. Then when you wake up, you can carefully grab them one at a time and bring it up to the bench and use its tail to tie its back legs together, neutralizing that horse. It would take a while, but eventually they’d all be neutralized, hobbling around on the ground, in the shit with their leg situation, and you could just step over them and walk away.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Why does the atmosphere of the earth circle around the earth? We circle with the earth because we are attached to the ground, but the atmosphere isn&#8217;t attached to the ground so why does it circle around with the planet?</span></strong> – <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Sinan A. (Baghdad, Iraq)</em></span></p>
<p>You say “we circle the earth because we are attached to the ground,” but what does “attached” mean? What it really means is there’s friction between our bodies and the surface of the earth that “pulls” our bodies. The oceans are less “attached” to the ground than a solid human body, but oceans rotate with the earth too, because there’s friction between the water molecules and the ocean floor. There’s less friction between the atmosphere and Earth’s surface than there is in the case of solid or liquid matter on the surface, but there’s still friction—which affects the atmosphere enough to pull it, too, along with Earth’s rotation.</p>
<p>But in all of these cases, friction is only why these things <em>initially</em> began to rotate along with the earth. Once something is up to full Earth rotational speed, the reason the atmosphere or anything else continues to rotate with the earth is inertia—an object in motion stays in motion. If the earth suddenly and instantly reversed rotational direction, there would be utter chaos on the surface, and everything would go flying. We, the oceans, and the atmosphere would all still carry the normal rotational velocity and the earth no longer would—kind of like when a moving car slams on the breaks and everything in the car lunges forward. But once the chaos settled down, the rotational velocity of all things on Earth’s surface would eventually be slowed down and reversed to match Earth’s new spin—because of friction. You’d be dead though.</p>

<p>This warrants a 12,000-word post, but for now, I’ll start with one idea:</p>
<p>I think a great way to be a good person is to get in the habit of consciously thinking about the fact that almost every stranger, co-worker, friend, acquaintance, fling, customer service representative, driver, waiter, customer, client, neighbor, and person on the internet you come across:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has a family who loves them and vice versa</li>
<li>Has hopes and dreams and regrets and frustrations</li>
<li>Has as many thoughts going through their head at all times as you do</li>
<li>Is dealing with random health problems, trying to make ends meet financially, and is probably tired</li>
<li>Might be supporting one or more other human beings</li>
<li>Might be just a little sad all the time about a tragedy in their past</li>
<li>Might be the most important person in someone else’s life</li>
<li>Is just trying to figure out how to be happy</li>
</ul>
<p>i.e. They’re a full human just like you.</p>
<p>Remembering that will make you kinder and more empathetic.</p>

<p>My sister had a blanket she was obsessed with as a toddler that she inexplicably called her Ninee (like “night” without the t and then “knee”). If you tried to take her Ninee away from her she flipped her shit. It was a critical part of her being.</p>
<p>My thermos is my Ninee. My ideal way to drink coffee is to slowly have one 16-ounce cup of black coffee over a four-hour span. Coffee in an open mug stays hot for like eight minutes. In a covered, paper take-out cup, maybe 15 minutes. Both totally unacceptable. I suffered for my whole life with this issue until I realized thermoses existed a few years ago. I got <a href="http://amzn.to/1W36cpp" target="_blank">this one</a> and it solved all my problems, with the added benefit of it being closable, so I can pop a full thermos in my bag or put it on the floor on an airplane (upright in my shoe).</p>
<p>Because I’m a child, I lose my thermos by leaving it somewhere about twice a year on average, but at $22, it’s only a little devastating every time it happens.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also recently gotten into the <a href="http://www.swellbottle.com/product/thermo-vacuum-insulated-reusable-water-bottle-shimmer-collection-silver-lining/?size=9oz" target="_blank">small S’well thermos</a>, which I use when I don’t have my bag because unlike my normal one, it fits in my jeans pocket.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>What do you think about hypnotherapy?<br />
</strong></span><strong>A relative of mine who is a very critical thinker recently became a &#8220;qualified hypnotherapist&#8221; which made me ponder how credible this field is. How does it work? Is it effective? And so on&#8230; </strong>–<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> <em>Matt B. (Leicester, UK)</em></span></p>
<p>I’m pretty sure those absurd stage hypnosis charades with a bunch of “hypnotized” people barking like a dog or having an orgasm or forgetting the number two on stage in front of a laughing crowd have to be some combo of people enjoying attention, peer pressure, and some element of placebo effect. No way that can be real.</p>
<p>But serious, one-on-one hypnotherapy? Sure, why not? The brain is weird, so why wouldn’t a trance-like state be able to be induced? From what I’ve read, hypnosis is just an extension of the phenomenon of a person getting so wrapped up in a thought that when someone calls their name, they don’t even hear it. That kind of hypnosis seems to be real, though it works on some people better than others and for some not at all. The problem for the credibility of hypnosis is all the fictional, cartoony hypnosis we’ve seen in movies, where the person is a robot who will do whatever the hypnotist says—pretty sure it doesn’t work like that.</p>
<p>I have a friend who’s been doing a type of hypnosis called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_desensitization_and_reprocessing" target="_blank">EMDR</a> with his therapist and claims that while doing so, a memory of <em>himself breastfeeding</em> flashed in his consciousness for a second. Nahhh, right? Or could it be possible?</p>

<p>One thing that will never be a problem for me is a shortage of post topics. I currently have a 116-page Word document full of topics, thoughts, questions, and random brainstorms I want to make into posts. Whenever I’m in an interesting conversation, or think of a funny observation, or find myself with an intriguing question, I write it in the doc. And if you just get in that habit, the potential-post-topic doc becomes long pretty quickly. To make it into the doc, a topic generally has to satisfy at least one of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s something I think people know about and hear about but generally don’t understand</li>
<li>It’s something about life we all notice subconsciously but we don’t usually think about it or put it into words</li>
<li>It’s something that many of us are feeling or thinking secretly but no one is saying</li>
<li>It’s something important that we don’t think about very intelligently because we don’t have a useful framework in our heads, or an important psychological concept that we should have a concrete label for but don’t</li>
<li>It’s something I come across that blows my mind and I know it’ll blow readers’ minds too</li>
</ul>
<p>When it&#8217;s time to start a new post, I scan down the big doc and pick something that excites me at that time. I get really exhausted by a topic by the time I&#8217;m done with it, so I try to mix things up—if the last post was really researchy, the next one might be more brainstormy, or if the last topic was heavy, I might pick something lighter next.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">What do I do if I always feel stupid?</span></strong><br />
<strong>There are so many awesome things in our world, e.g. gravitational astronomy, physics of superconducters, neuroscience, genetics, AI, space exploration, math problems, WBW posts. Well, you get it. Much more than an average person could ever learn, I guess. Therefore my question is: what do I do if I always feel stupid? Like, really, always.</strong> –<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em> Katie S. (Russia)</em></span></p>
<p>Stupid is when you don’t know that much about anything and you feel like everyone else does. The good news is, everyone else doesn’t. At all. The world is full of exciting, complex things that almost no one understands. Once you realize this, all the stuff you don’t know isn’t upsetting, it’s <em>exciting</em>.</p>
<p>It’s like reading. I’ve read a bunch of good books, but there are 1,000 times as many that I haven’t read. If I believed that most people had read most books and for some reason I had not, I’d feel embarrassingly not-well-read. But because I know that most people haven’t read most books, I can take my own situation out of the thought process and just enjoy the fact that I’ll never run out of good new books to read.</p>
<p>So even though people sometimes present themselves as more knowledgeable about more things than they really are, remember that really, most people don’t know much about anything, and try to get excited about the fact that with every year of your life that goes by, you’ll know more and more and more.</p>
<p>And remember, to actually learn about a topic you don&#8217;t get, you have to build a tree trunk foundation of understanding before you can start tacking onto that foundation by adding on branches and leaves (like news articles about recent developments). The thing that makes people feel stupid is trying to absorb branches and leaves when they don&#8217;t yet have a tree trunk, so it always goes in one ear and out the other and you feel like it&#8217;s hopeless for you to ever grasp the topic—but it&#8217;s not.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Do you cook much? If so, what is your favorite cookbook (or chef, cooking website, etc)?</strong> </span>– <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Al T. (Charlottesville, VA)</em></span></p>
<p>Cooking some elaborate thing using a recipe is for me like reading fiction—when I do it, I thoroughly enjoy it, but I do it like once a year. Mostly, I keep it to things like stir frying vegetables and rice, which is an excuse to have a condiment/spices party.</p>
<p>As for cookbooks, I recently got J. Kenji Lopez-Alt’s <a href="http://amzn.to/1SE5cEB" target="_blank">The Food Lab</a>, which is delightful so far. Not a big chef fanboy person, although I had a phase with Bobby Flay’s <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/boy-meets-grill.html" target="_blank"><em>Boy Meets Grill</em></a> show at one point and I’m pretty infatuated with how cocky and rad <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Bowien" target="_blank">Danny Bowien</a> is (the Mission Chinese guy).</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>How does wind work? What is the mechanism behind wind happening? Why does it happen?</strong> </span>–<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em> Steven H. (Cape Girardeau, MO)</em></span></p>
<p>I’ll need to read about how weather works for 30 hours before I can give a proper answer to this question, but I’ll take a crack.</p>
<p>The key to wind is air <em>pressure</em>. Forget the atmosphere for a second and take a breath in. What happens? Air from outside your body rushes into your body. Now exhale—and air rushes back out. What’s happening is that the air outside your body is staying at the same pressure level, but when you inhale, you’re increasing the volume in your lungs, which lowers the air molecules / volume ratio in your lungs, which lowers the air pressure in your lungs. Air always “wants” to <em>even </em>things out, so air rushes into your lungs to accommodate for the extra space created by your inhale and equalize the pressure inside and outside of you. When you exhale, you’re decreasing the volume in your lungs, which increases the air pressure to a level higher than the air outside your body, so air rushes out to make things equal.</p>
<p>When the sun heats up parts of the atmosphere, the air rises, which leaves less air down near the surface than normal—a low pressure system. Hot air rising and leaving a void underneath is kind of like the atmosphere “inhaling.” Just like what happens in your expanding lungs, air from higher pressure systems surrounding the low pressure system rushes in to equalize things—i.e. the low pressure area “sucks” in surrounding air. In the reverse situation, when there’s a higher-than-normal pressure system in the atmosphere, it’s like a human exhaling. The higher pressure system presses outward into lower pressure areas and the air rushes there to equalize things. That rushing air is what we experience as wind. Wind is just air moving from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure.</p>

<p>No idea. But I included this odd question so someone who knows can explain it to all of us in the comments.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">What’s one of the most important life lessons you&#8217;ve learned in your years so far that you would give to a young adult/college student?</span></strong> – <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Cathy J. (Toronto, Canada)</em></span></p>
<p>Making really close lifelong friends is a hard thing to do for most people, and it gets even harder once you hit the real world and everyone lives in isolated apartments and spends their days at work. Really close friendships are built by spending a ton of hours with the same person or group of people again and again, and there’s nowhere better to foster that than college or the years after college when people often live with roommates.</p>
<p>Given that, one piece of advice would be to first, assess your friendships and figure out who’s in Q1 (<a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Graph.png" target="_blank">here’s a refresher</a> on what Q1 is, from <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/10-types-odd-friendships-youre-probably-part.html" target="_blank">this post</a>).</p>
<p>Then, invest in those friendships, and remember that lazy afternoons sitting around doing nothing with them might seem mundane, but it’s actually building a foundation of closeness and comfort that you’ll be thankful for later. It’s time well spent.</p>
<p>And if you don’t think many of your friends are in Q1, ask yourself why that might be. Maybe you’re not hanging out with the right kind of people for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Can you share any advice on becoming a good writer?</strong></span> – <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>James M. (Dublin, Ireland)</em></span></p>
<p>1) Write. I wrote 300 blog posts between the ages of 23 and 29 before starting Wait But Why. It can take a while to find your voice and your tone and your style. At the beginning, you’ll be all over the place, the same way you are when you try a new sport or video game or musical instrument. That’s good—you’re experimenting on a canvas. Don’t judge your own writing at this phase—you’re experimenting and searching and playing—you’re not doing your best writing yet. If your <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html" target="_blank">mammoth</a> is freaking out too much and ruining things, start with an anonymous blog.</p>
<p>2) Don’t be a complete perfectionist, but don’t settle for writing you know isn’t working. Even if you’re experimenting, if something you’re trying isn’t working, try to figure out why, rewrite parts, start over and try a new approach, etc.—keep fiddling until it clicks. Each time you go through the hard, painful work of agonizing over writing that isn’t working and eventually get it to click, you become a better writer.</p>
<p>3) Read a lot. It’s like fertilizer.</p>
<p>4) On one side of the spectrum, you’re completely copying the exact style and even the wording of another writer you like—let’s call that a 1. On the other side, you’re completely unique, writing in a way the world has never seen before—let’s call it a 10. Your goal is to start somewhere in the middle and then work your way up the scale as you mature as a writer. That said, having influences is inevitable and perfectly okay, because true 10s don’t exist. This same concept applies to stand-up comedy, music, or any other type of art. It’s a badge of honor to say The Beatles are one of your influences, but no one likes a songwriter who’s blatantly copying The Beatles. Without getting to a 7 or 8 on the uniqueness spectrum, there’s likely a ceiling on how high your writing career can go.</p>
<p>5) While you’re experimenting with your writing, keep your mind open to all creative possibilities. The first 290 of the 300 blog posts I wrote in my 20s had no visuals. Only towards the very end did I try drawing something one night. And only then did I realize how much I liked combining hand-drawn visuals with my writing. That could have easily never happened, and if it hadn’t, Wait But Why would be an all-text blog today.</p>
<p>6) If you get feedback as you grow as a writer, be careful who it’s coming from. The person giving feedback should A) believe in you, B) be rooting for you, and C) be completely aware that what they’re reading isn&#8217;t your max potential but you experimenting, gaining confidence, and trying to figure out your voice. A person who satisfies all of those is great to get feedback from. Someone who fails any of those criteria is going to do you more harm than good, and will often be the person who makes you quit prematurely and never try again (even if you don’t realize they’re the reason that happened).</p>
<p>7) Remember that in most cases, the ideas behind the writing are more important than the quality of the writing itself. You’d rather have great ideas and pretty good writing than the other way around.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Do you speak any other languages?</span> </strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>– Ricardo K. (Vinhedo, Brazil)</em></span></p>
<p>I speak 1.43 languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>English</li>
<li>40% of Spanish</li>
<li>1% of French</li>
<li>0.1% of about 20 other languages because I learned how to say a few sentences when I visited a country where that was the language</li>
</ul>
<p>My .4 Spanish capabilities are super useful when I visit Spanish-speaking countries, but mostly when I need to say something to someone. Once I finish, the party’s over. For some reason, my brain decided to not ever learn to understand what the fuck anyone is saying when they speak Spanish to me.</p>
<p>My problem is that I never learned Spanish well enough to do that thing where you have a Spanish part of your brain. So instead, I’ve memorized a ton of Spanish words and when I speak to someone, I’m doing what people who are bad at languages do—I’m rapid-fire translating in my head with each word that comes out of my mouth. I’m proficient enough to get around a Spanish-speaking country and even have conversations with people—as long as they don’t say anything back. When they do, it’s like someone throwing five tennis balls at me every second and expecting me to somehow catch all of them. So I go into a panic and just keep saying “lentamente” until their pace comes down so far that I can figure out what they’re saying.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">How many people have ever lived? </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>I have a question I figured only WBW could answer properly. </strong><strong>It came up when I took a shower and I thought: &#8220;Wow, it&#8217;s kinda crazy that most people from the beginning of time till now haven&#8217;t felt the pressure of a hot shower,&#8221; since I guess that showers as we know it were invented only a couple of centuries ago (hot bath doesn&#8217;t count). </strong><strong>But then I thought&#8230; Is it true? There are approximately 7.4 billion people in the world today, and I think the numbers got that big only recently.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>This made me ponder: how many people have lived on Earth since the beginning of humanity? What percentage of them lived in the last 200 years? </strong>–<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em> Zohar A. (Tel Aviv, Israel)</em></span></p>
<p>I’ve thought about the shower thing before. It’s incredible. Imagine being stranded on an island with only basic tools and trying to create an extended hot shower for yourself. Not gonna happen. A hot shower requires a ton of technology. In the interest of not spending two hours reading enough about the history of showers to be able to piece together an estimate for the number of people who have ever had access to a hot shower, I’ll leave it at that thought for now—though I’d be delighted if a reader would like to figure this out and put it in the comments.</p>
<p>As for the number of people who have ever lived, Carl Haub at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.prb.org/" target="_blank">Population Reference Bureau</a></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.prb.org/pdf/PT_novdec02.pdf" target="_blank">estimated</a></span> in 2011 that about 107 billion people have lived:</p>

<p>I made a chart about this stat once in a <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/03/7-3-billion-people-one-building.html" target="_blank">post</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/108B-1024x787.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5166" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/108B-1024x787.png" alt="108B-1024x787" width="500" height="384" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/108B-1024x787.png 1024w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/108B-1024x787-300x231.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/108B-1024x787-768x590.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/108B-1024x787-600x461.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Of course, Haub’s or anyone else’s estimate for this is imprecise and up for debate, especially since people aren’t even in agreement about when humans “started”. Either way, the fact that around 1/15 of all people who have ever lived are currently alive struck me as very high, considering that the past century accounts for at most 1/500 of the <em>time </em>humans have been around.</p>
<p>In the same <a href="http://www.prb.org/pdf/PT_novdec02.pdf" target="_blank">article</a>, Haub estimates that about 40% of those who have ever lived died before their first birthday and estimates that &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy_at_birth" target="_blank">life expectancy at birth</a> probably averaged only about ten years for most of human history.&#8221; If he’s right, it would mean that 1/10 of all humans age 1 or older who have ever lived are currently alive, and that fraction would become higher and higher as you increase the age. So maybe 1/5 of all 30+ year olds who have ever lived are currently alive and maybe a third of people who ever lived to 60 are still alive. And I’d bet that the <em>majority</em> of people 90 or over who have ever lived are alive right now. All guesses, but it seems logical.</p>

So, I decided to save it and show my family. I was taken aback when they reacted with disgust. My sister seems to think they look like &#8220;ugly pigs&#8221; and my mother has mentioned that they are too fat to be cute. It&#8217;s become a pretty heated debate.

<p>Fuckin shit, Abigail. This is literally what would happen if a human and a dog could breed. And in trying to figure out my thoughts on what you’ve presented to me, I’ve stared at it so long—especially the dog on the right—that I now have no idea what these creatures are. Also, I can only picture them having the same texture and consistency as a Stretch Armstrong toy if you pressed into their flesh. Like I’m picturing their skin being frictiony and rubbery, not anything like a biological creature. I&#8217;ve gone through a lot in the last few minutes—too much to really answer your question. If I had to answer, I&#8217;d say affection is closer to what I&#8217;m feeling than disgust, so I guess I agree with you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;re on an airplane when you hear a loud sound and things start violently shaking. A minute later, the captain comes on the speaker and says:</p>
<p><em>There&#8217;s been an explosion in the engine, and the plane is going to crash in 15 minutes. There’s no chance of survival. There is a potential way out—the plane happens to be transferring a shipment of parachutes, and anyone who would like to use one to escape the plane may do so. But I must warn you—the parachutes are experimental and completely untested, with no guarantee to work. We also have no idea what the terrain will be like down below. Please line up in the aisle if you&#8217;d like a parachute, and the flight attendants will give you one, show you how to use it and usher you to the emergency exit where you can jump. Those who choose not to take that option, please remain in your seat—this will be over soon, and you will feel no pain.</em></p>
<p>What would you do?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p>When Robert Ettinger was a kid in the 1930s, he read a lot of science fiction, and he assumed that with the world advancing the way it was, scientists would surely have a cure for aging at some point during his lifetime. He would live to see a world where sickness was a thing of the past and death was something people chose to do voluntarily, at a time of their choosing.<a href="#footnote-1-4836" id="note-1-4836" rel="footnote">1</a><a href="#footnote2-1-4836" id="note2-1-4836" rel="footnote2">1</a></span><span style="font-size: large;"><sup>← New to WBW? Open these.</sup></span></p>
<p>But thirty years later, aging and involuntary death were still very much a thing, and Ettinger, by then a physics professor, realized that science might not solve these problems in time for him to reap the benefits. So he started thinking about how to hack the system.</p>
<p>If, rather than being buried or cremated after his death, he could instead be frozen in some way—then whenever the scientists <em>did </em>eventually get around to conquering mortality, they&#8217;d probably also have the tools and know-how to resuscitate him, and he could have the last laugh after all.</p>
<p>In 1962, he wrote about this concept in a book called <em><a href="http://www.cryonics.org/images/uploads/misc/Prospect_Book.pdf" target="_blank">The Prospects of Immortality</a></em>, and the cryonics movement was born.</p>
<p>The first person to give cryonics a try was James Bedford, a psychology professor who died of cancer in 1967 at the age of 73 and is doing his thing in a vat of liquid nitrogen in Arizona as you read this. Others slowly began to follow, and today, there are over 300 people hanging out in vats of liquid nitrogen.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s pause for a second. A year ago, I knew almost nothing about cryonics, and my impressions of it were something like this sentence:</p>
<p><em>Cryonics, or cryogenics, is the morbid process of freezing rich, dead people who can&#8217;t accept the concept of death, in the hopes that people from the future will be able to bring them back to life, and the community of hard-core cryonics people might also be a Scientology-like cult.</em></p>
<p>Then I started learning about it. It&#8217;s your fault—cryonics is one of the potential-future-post-topics people email me about most, and it&#8217;s something at least five readers have brought up in conversation when I&#8217;ve met them in person. And as I began to read about cryonics, I soon learned that a lot of the words in my italicized assumption sentence weren&#8217;t correct.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s work our way through the sentence as we go over exactly what cryonics is and how it works. We&#8217;ll start with this part:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cryonics, or cryogenics,</span> is the morbid process of freezing rich, dead people who can&#8217;t accept the concept of death, in the hopes that people from the future will be able to bring them back to life, and the community of hard-core cryonics people might also be a Scientology-like cult.</strong></p>
<p>It turns out that this is like saying, &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRqnTODwvEA" target="_blank">Wingsuit flying</a>, or meteorology, is the sport of flying through the air using a wingsuit.&#8221; Meteorology is the study of what happens in the atmosphere, which includes how wind works, and wingsuit flying is a process that harnesses the wind—and you&#8217;d be an odd person if you thought they were the same thing.</p>
<p>Likewise, cryogenics is a<span class="s1"> branch of physics that studies the production and effects of very low temperatures, while cryonics is the practice of using very low temperatures to try to preserve a human being. Not the same thing.</span></p>
<p>Next, we have a string of three misleading words to talk about:</p>
<p><strong>Cryonics is the morbid process of <span style="color: #ff0000;">freezing rich, dead</span> people who can&#8217;t accept the concept of death, in the hopes that people from the future will be able to bring them back to life, <strong>and the community of hard-core cryonics people might also be a Scientology-like cult.</strong></strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll address these three words by going through how cryonics works, starting at the beginning.</p>
<p>So you decide you want to be a cryonicist. Here are the steps:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Step 1) Pick a company</strong></span></p>
<p>There are four major companies that provide cryonics services—<a href="http://www.alcor.org/" target="_blank">Alcor</a> in Arizona, <a href="http://www.cryonics.org/" target="_blank">Cryonics Institute</a> (CI) in Michigan, <a href="http://www.AmericanCryonics.org/" target="_blank">American Cryonics Society</a> (ACS) in California, and <a href="http://www.kriorus.com/en" target="_blank">KrioRus</a> in Russia. KrioRus is the newest option and quickly up-and-coming, but the two big boys are Alcor and CI (ACS doesn&#8217;t have their own storage facilities—they store with CI).</p>
<p>From my perusing, it seems like Alcor is the slightly-more-legit and fancier of the two, while CI (which was started by Robert Ettinger, the guy who launched the movement) is more affordable and gives off more of a mom-and-pop vibe. Both are nonprofit, and each has about 150 people in storage. Alcor has a little over 1,000 &#8220;members&#8221; (i.e. people who will one day be in storage), and CI has around half that number.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Step 2) </strong><strong>Become a member</strong></span></p>
<p>To become a cryonicist, you need to fill out some paperwork, sign some stuff and get it notarized, and pay for three things: an annual membership fee, a transport fee to get your body to the facility after you die, and a treatment/storage/revival fee.</p>
<p>Alcor&#8217;s <a href="http://www.alcor.org/BecomeMember/scheduleA.html" target="_blank">annual membership fee</a> is about $700, and their transport fee is bundled together with the treatment/storage/revival fee—together they cost $200,000. Alcor gives you the option of ditching your body and just freezing your brain (this is called &#8220;neuropreservation&#8221;), which brings the price down to $80,000.</p>
<p>CI&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cryonics.org/ci-landing/funding-for-cryostasis/" target="_blank">annual membership fee</a> is $120 (or a one-time fee of $1,250 for a lifetime membership) and the treatment, etc. costs $35,000 ($28,000 for lifetime members). This is so much cheaper than Alcor for two main reasons:</p>
<p>First, it doesn&#8217;t include the transport. If you live near the facility, you can save a lot of money. If not, you&#8217;ll need to go through their partner for a transport contract, which costs $95,000 ($88,000 for lifetime members).</p>
<p>Second, Alcor uses more than half of their large fee to fund what they call their <a href="http://www.alcor.org/AboutAlcor/patientcaretrustfund.html" target="_blank">Patient Care Trust</a>. Back in the 70s, there were more cryonics companies, and some of them went bankrupt, which meant their frozen people stopped being frozen, which was a not ideal outcome. Alcor&#8217;s trust is a backup fund to make sure their &#8220;patients&#8221; won&#8217;t be affected by something like a company financial crisis.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Step 3) Get a life insurance policy in the name of your new cryonics company</strong></span></p>
<p>Sounds shady, right? But it also makes sense. Both Alcor and CI are small companies on a pretty tight budget and neither can afford to offer a payment plan to be hopefully paid out by your estate or your relatives. On the patient end, unless you&#8217;re rich, cryonics fees are huge, and a life insurance policy guaranteed to pay your full cryonics fee forces you to save for this fee throughout your life. For young people, even sizable life insurance policies are pretty cheap—with CI, you could be totally covered for as little as $300/year ($120 annual membership, $180 life insurance policy to cover the main fee). Even for Alcor&#8217;s more expensive package, costs shouldn&#8217;t exceed $100/month.</p>
<p>Those fees aren&#8217;t nothing, but the whole life insurance thing, at least when it comes to younger people, pretty effectively ejects &#8220;rich&#8221; from our black and red sentence. If it costs the same as cable or a cigarette habit, you don&#8217;t need to be rich to pay for it.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Step 4) Put on your bracelet and go on living your life</strong></span></p>
<p>Cryonics members are given <a href="http://alcor.org/BecomeMember/" target="_blank">a bracelet and a necklace</a>, etched with instructions and contact info, and encouraged to wear one at all times, so if you suddenly die, whoever finds you will know to notify the company.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Step 5) Die</strong></span></p>
<p>Okay here&#8217;s where things get tricky. We think of the divide between life and death as a distinct boundary, and we believe that at any given point, a person is either definitively alive or definitively dead. But let&#8217;s examine that assumption for a second:</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s first talk about what it means when a person is &#8220;doomed&#8221; from a health standpoint. We can all agree that what constitutes someone being doomed depends on where, and when, they are. A three-year-old with advanced pneumonia in 1740 would probably have been doomed, while the same child with the same condition today might be fully treatable. The same story could be said of the fate of someone who falls badly ill in a remote village in Malawi compared with their fate if they were in London instead. “Doomed” depends on a number of factors.</p>
<p>That the same thing can be said of “dead” is at first pretty unintuitive. But Alcor&#8217;s CEO Max More puts it this way: &#8220;Fifty years ago if you were walking along the street and someone keeled over in front of you and stopped breathing you would have checked them out and said they were dead and disposed of them. Today we don’t do that, instead we do CPR and all kinds of things. People we thought were dead 50 years ago we now know were not.&#8221;<a href="#footnote2-2-4836" id="note2-2-4836" rel="footnote2">2</a>
<p>Today, dead means the heart has been stopped for 4-6 minutes, because that&#8217;s how long the brain can go without oxygen before brain death occurs. But Alcor, in its site&#8217;s <a href="http://www.alcor.org/sciencefaq.htm" target="_blank">Science FAQ</a>, explains that &#8220;the brain &#8216;dies&#8217; after several minutes without oxygen not because it is immediately destroyed, but because of a cascade of processes that commit it to destruction in the hours that follow restoration of warm blood circulation. Restoring circulation with cool blood instead of warm blood, reopening blocked vessels with high pressure, avoiding excessive oxygenation, and blocking cell death with drugs can prevent this destruction.&#8221;<a href="#footnote2-3-4836" id="note2-3-4836" rel="footnote2">3</a> The site goes on to explain that &#8220;with new experimental treatments, more than 10 minutes of warm cardiac arrest can now be survived without brain injury. Future technologies for molecular repair may extend the frontiers of resuscitation beyond 60 minutes or more, making today&#8217;s beliefs about when death occurs obsolete.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, what we think of as &#8220;dead&#8221; actually means “doomed, under the current circumstances.” Someone fifty years ago who suffered from cardiac arrest wasn&#8217;t dead, they were doomed to die because the medical technology at the time couldn&#8217;t save them. Today, that person wouldn&#8217;t be considered dead yet because they wouldn&#8217;t be doomed yet. Instead, someone today &#8220;dies&#8221; 4-6 minutes after cardiac arrest, because that happens to be how long someone can currently go before modern technology can no longer help them.</p>
<p>Cryonicists view death not as a singular <em>event</em>, but as a <em>process</em>—one that starts when the heart stops beating and ends later at a point called &#8220;the information-theoretic criterion for death&#8221;—let&#8217;s call it &#8220;info death&#8221;—when the brain has become so damaged that no amount of present <em>or future </em>technology could restore it to its original state or have any way to retrieve its information.</p>
<p>Here’s an interesting way to think about it: Imagine a patient arriving in an ambulance to Hospital A, a typical modern hospital. The patient&#8217;s heart stopped 15 minutes before the EMTs arrived and he is immediately pronounced dead at the hospital. What if, though, the doctors at Hospital A learned that Hospital B across the street had developed a radical new technology that could revive a patient anytime within <em>60</em> minutes after cardiac arrest with no long-term damage? What would the people at Hospital A do?</p>
<p>Of course, they would rush the patient across the street to Hospital B to save him. If Hospital B did save the patient, then by definition the patient wouldn&#8217;t actually have been dead in Hospital A, just <em>pronounced dead</em> because Hospital A viewed him as entirely and without exception <em>doomed</em>.</p>
<p>What cryonicists suggest is that in many cases where today a patient is pronounced dead, they&#8217;re not dead but rather doomed, and that there is a Hospital B that can save the day—but instead of being in a different <i>place</i>, it’s in a different <i>time</i>. It&#8217;s in the future.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why cryonicists adamantly assert that cryonics does <em>not </em>deal with dead people—it deals with living people who simply need to be transferred to a future hospital to be saved. They believe that in many cases, today&#8217;s corpse is tomorrow&#8217;s patient (which is why they call their frozen clients &#8220;patients&#8221; instead of &#8220;corpses&#8221; or &#8220;remains&#8221;), and they view their work as essentially &#8220;extended emergency medicine.&#8221;<a href="#footnote2-4-4836" id="note2-4-4836" rel="footnote2">4</a>
<p>But it’s emergency medicine with an important caveat. Today&#8217;s technology has no way to revive a cryonically-suspended patient, so it isn&#8217;t considered a medical procedure by the law but rather a weird kind of coffin—i.e. if you cryopreserve someone who hasn&#8217;t yet been pronounced dead, it&#8217;s seen by the law as homicide. Even if the patient is terminally ill beyond any hope and adamantly doesn&#8217;t want to deteriorate further before being cryopreserved, it&#8217;s not an option—at least not under current laws (laws that some are <a href="http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/donaldson.html" target="_blank">trying to change</a>). This puts cryonicists in a tough bind—and it&#8217;s exactly where that differing definition of death comes in handy.</p>
<p>The law does not see death as a process. For a long time, legal death in the US was considered to occur when a person&#8217;s heartbeat and breathing stopped. As modern medical procedures like CPR and defibrillators started to allow those patients to be resuscitated, the law had to <a href="http://www.uniformlaws.org/ActSummary.aspx?title=Determination%20of%20Death%20Act" target="_blank">change the definition</a> of legal death to include &#8220;irreversible cessation of all functions of the brain.&#8221;<a href="#footnote2-5-4836" id="note2-5-4836" rel="footnote2">5</a> The old &#8220;heartbeat and breathing&#8221; definition of legal death is now called &#8220;clinical death,&#8221; a middle ground point where there&#8217;s an obligation to attempt resuscitation in most cases but where a patient can also have a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order in place (common with terminally ill patients).<a href="#footnote-2-4836" id="note-2-4836" rel="footnote">2</a> In DNR cases, a doctor or nurse will pronounce a clinically dead patient to be legally dead—even though a resuscitation effort could still revive them.</p>
<p>This is a critical fact for cryonics. Cryonics technicians have to wait until legal death to begin their work on a patient, but with the help of a patient&#8217;s DNR order, they can start the process right after the heart stops, well before any brain damage sets in.</p>
<p>So this is the window for cryonics:</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Death-chart-2.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-5063"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5063" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Death-chart-2.png" alt="Death chart" width="900" height="463" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Death-chart-2.png 1646w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Death-chart-2-300x154.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Death-chart-2-768x395.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Death-chart-2-600x308.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>Which brings us back to our list, where we can now clarify what we really mean with Step 5:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Step 5) Legally Die</strong></span></p>
<p>You legally dying is a key step along the way here, so don&#8217;t mess it up. You can do it the good way, the bad way, or the really bad way.</p>
<p><strong>The good way:</strong> Something predictable where you&#8217;re in a cliché deathbed situation, like cancer. This allows you to get yourself on a plane to either Scottsdale (Alcor) or Michigan (CI) and into one of the specifically designated hospice care facilities that the cryonics company regularly works with. This is important because cryonics is highly controversial within the mainstream medical community and often not well-regarded or well-understood. As a result, some hospitals and hospice care facilities are &#8220;cryonics friendly&#8221; and others are not (those that aren&#8217;t have been known to make it difficult for cryonics staff to do what they need to do or deny them the same privileges organ transplant specialists get in a hospital). Once you’re in hospice care, the cryonics company can put staff on standby around the clock, so that the second you legally die, they can be there to start the treatment.</p>
<p><strong>The bad way: </strong>Something sudden and unexpected, like a heart attack, where at best, someone is there and can contact the cryonics company as you&#8217;re rushed to the hospital so they can meet you there, or worse, where you&#8217;re dead for a few hours or even longer before anyone finds you. In these circumstances, the cryonics company will do the best they can. Your brain will be in worse shape than ideal when you go into cryopreservation, but again, who knows what future technology will be able to accomplish, and as long as you&#8217;re still somewhere in the &#8220;cryonics window&#8221; and still in the <em>process </em>of dying, not yet having reached info death, there remains hope.</p>
<p><strong>The really bad way: </strong>A violent accident or something where your brain ends up badly damaged. In the worst of these cases, there&#8217;s not much cryonics can do to help—like the Alcor member who died in the September 11th attacks.<a href="#footnote2-6-4836" id="note2-6-4836" rel="footnote2">6</a> Another bad ending would be dying in a foul-play situation that would lead the police to want to do an autopsy (Alcor <a href="http://www.alcor.org/BecomeMember/toprotectyourself.html" target="_blank">suggests</a> its members file a no-autopsy-for-religious-reasons form with the government). A woman who has signed up for cryonics did a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/knfcx/i_am_signed_up_for_cryonics_at_my_death_ama/" target="_blank">Reddit AMA</a>, and when one of the questions was about how signing up had changed her life, she answered, &#8220;The biggest change I&#8217;ve noticed is that I&#8217;m more careful. I drive slower and more cautiously/attentively, I pay more attention to what&#8217;s going on around me.&#8221; Because she doesn&#8217;t want to die the really bad way.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Step 6) Cool off ASAP and get transferred to the cryonics facility</strong></span></p>
<p>After you&#8217;re declared legally dead, the cryonics team will, ideally, immediately get going. The first thing they do is two-fold—they put you in an ice water bath to bring down your temperature and slow your metabolism (so any damage taking place as a result of cardiac arrest takes longer to happen), and they start getting your heart and lungs working again so that the body remains in stable condition. They do this by administering CPS (like CPR but with an S for support instead of an R for resuscitation, because they&#8217;re not trying to resuscitate you) using a mechanical heart-lung resuscitator called a <a href="http://assets1.mytrainsite.com/501494/ems.png?r=1280" target="_blank">thumper</a>:<a href="#footnote2-7-4836" id="note2-7-4836" rel="footnote2">7</a>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.michiganinstruments.com/trade-in-program" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-5017"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5017 size-full" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ems.png" alt="ems" width="296" height="197" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ems.png 296w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ems-103x70.png 103w" sizes="(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px" /></a></p>
<p>Then they inject you with a number of different medicines to make sure you don&#8217;t get blood clots or start rotting.</p>
<p>Once that&#8217;s under control, they can do a more involved procedure that surgically accesses the major blood vessels in your thigh and hooks them up to this guy:<a href="#footnote2-8-4836" id="note2-8-4836" rel="footnote2">8</a>
<p><a href="http://www.alcor.org/Library/pdfs/atp.pdf" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-5018"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5018 size-full" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ATP3.jpg" alt="ATP3" width="500" height="366" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ATP3.jpg 500w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ATP3-300x220.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a heart-lung machine that takes care of circulation and oxygenation so they can stop the much cruder CPS. In addition to circulating your blood, the machine draws heat out of your body, cooling it to just above the freezing temperature of water, and replaces some of your blood with an organ preservation solution that supports life at super low temperatures (this is similar to how transplant surgeons keep organs alive when they have to transport them long distances).</p>
<p>If you have to be flown to the cryonics facility, they pack you in ice and put you on board what they hope is not your last ever flight.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Step 7) Get vitrified</strong></span></p>
<p>Most people who know what cryonics is think it means getting frozen. It doesn&#8217;t. It means getting vitrified.</p>
<p>Glass is weird. It&#8217;s not a typical solid because as it cools from its liquid phase, it never crystallizes into an orderly structure. But, as I learned when a bunch of commenters yelled at me after I published this post, it&#8217;s not actually a liquid either, since <a href="http://www.cmog.org/article/does-glass-flow" target="_blank">it doesn&#8217;t flow</a>. So, it&#8217;s neither a typical solid nor a liquid—it&#8217;s an &#8220;amorphous solid,&#8221; sometimes compared to a <a href="http://www.cmog.org/article/does-glass-flow" target="_blank">giant molecule</a>. For our purposes, the key is that <em>like a liquid</em>, glass doesn&#8217;t crystallize—rather, as it cools the molecules just move slower and slower until they stop.</p>
<p>If you <em>froze</em> a human, all the liquid water in their body would eventually hit its freezing point and crystallize<em> </em>into a solid. That wouldn&#8217;t be good—first, water ice takes up about 9% more volume than water liquid, so it would expand and badly damage tissue, and second, the sharp ice crystals would slice through cell membranes and other tissue around it.</p>
<p>So to avoid that catastrophic liquid-to-solid state change, cryonics technicians do something cool—they perform surgery through the chest and hook the major arteries up to tubes which pump all the blood out of the body, replacing it with a &#8220;cryoprotectant solution,&#8221; otherwise known as medical grade anti-freeze. This does two important things: it replaces 60% of the water in the body&#8217;s cells, and it lowers the freezing point of what liquid is left. The result, when done perfectly, is that no freezing happens in the body. Instead, as they chill your body down and down over the next three hours, it hits -124ºC, a key point called the &#8220;glass transition temperature&#8221; when the body&#8217;s liquid stays amorphous but rises so high in viscosity that no molecule can budge. You&#8217;re officially an amorphous solid, like glass—i.e. you&#8217;re <em>vitrified.</em></p>
<p>With no molecule movement, all chemical activity in your body comes to a halt. Biological time is stopped. You&#8217;re on pause.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m sure you’re feeling skeptical, it’s helpful to note that vitrifying biological parts is nothing new. We&#8217;ve been successfully vitrifying and then rewarming human embryos, sperm, skin, bone, and other body parts for a while now. More recently, scientists <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2781097/" target="_blank">vitrified a rabbit kidney</a>:<a href="#footnote2-9-4836" id="note2-9-4836" rel="footnote2">9</a>
<p><a href="http://www.alcor.org/cryomyths.html" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-5019"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5019 size-full" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/kidney.jpg" alt="kidney" width="350" height="263" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/kidney.jpg 350w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/kidney-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a></p>
<p>Then they rewarmed it and put it back in the rabbit. And it still worked.</p>
<p>And just in February of 2016, there was a cryonics breakthrough when for the first time, scientists vitrified a rabbit&#8217;s brain and showed that once rewarmed, it was in <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/332074-cryonics-rabbit-brain-regenerated/" target="_blank">near-perfect condition</a>, &#8220;with the cell membranes, synapses, and intracellular structures intact &#8230; [It was] the first time a cryopreservation was provably able to protect everything associated with learning and memory.&#8221;<a href="#footnote2-10-4836" id="note2-10-4836" rel="footnote2">10</a>
<p>Once you&#8217;re vitrified, you need to keep being chilled, little by little, until after about two weeks, you&#8217;re down to -196ºC. Why? Because that&#8217;s the point at which nitrogen becomes a liquid, and you&#8217;re about to take a long-term liquid nitrogen bath.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Step 8) Go into storage</strong></span></p>
<p>Or as Alcor euphemistically calls it, &#8220;long-term care.&#8221; The new vitrified you now goes into what is essentially a large upright thermos that&#8217;s about 10 feet tall and 3.5 feet wide.<a href="#footnote2-11-4836" id="note2-11-4836" rel="footnote2">11</a>
<p><a href="http://www.alcor.org/AtWork/index.html" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-5021"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5021 size-full" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/p12.jpg" alt="p12" width="208" height="350" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/p12.jpg 208w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/p12-178x300.jpg 178w" sizes="(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px" /></a></p>
<p>You meet your new neighbors—three other vitrified people, each in their respective quadrant of the thermos, along with five people traveling super lean, with no body, whose heads are stacked in the middle column.<a href="#footnote2-12-4836" id="note2-12-4836" rel="footnote2">12</a>
<p><a href="http://www.alcor.org/AtWork/index.html" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-5020"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5020 size-full" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/P11.jpg" alt="P11" width="220" height="350" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/P11.jpg 220w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/P11-189x300.jpg 189w" sizes="(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px" /></a></p>
<p>Or, if you&#8217;re in a heads-only thermos, you&#8217;ll be one of 45 brains sharing the space (the brain is what&#8217;s being stored, but they keep the brains in their heads because it&#8217;s riskier to remove a brain than to just keep it in there and use the head as a carrying case).</p>
<p>Oh, and you&#8217;re upside-down. This is because liquid nitrogen boils off gradually from the top of the container. Normally, it&#8217;s no problem—the staff tops it off about once a week. But if, in some worst-case scenario, a container was forced to be left for a long time, the head would be the last thing to be affected—upside-down patients means it would take six months before the nitrogen boiled off so far that the head would be exposed.</p>
<p>And when it comes to blackouts, cryonics patients are totally safe—there&#8217;s no electricity involved in their storage.</p>
<p>And this is where you&#8217;ll hang out. Maybe for 10 years. Maybe for 150 years. Maybe for 1,200 years. But the time doesn&#8217;t matter to you. You&#8217;re on pause.</p>
<p>Now&#8217;s a good time for us to take a step back and look at the big picture. If Point A is &#8220;I&#8217;ve decided I want to sign up for cryonics,&#8221; and Point B is &#8220;Oh cool it&#8217;s the year 2482 and here I am doing stuff,&#8221; there are four major Ifs that need to all go the right way to take you from A to B:</p>
<p><strong>1) If I legally die in a not really bad way and everything goes as planned with getting me into the thermos</strong></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><strong>2) If future humanity ever reaches a point where it has the technology to revive me to full health</strong></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><strong>3) If the cryonics company can manage to store me safely and uninterrupted until that point</strong></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><strong>4) If when that point comes, the outside world actually does take action to revive me</strong></p>
<p>—then I&#8217;ll be there in 2482 doing stuff.</p>
<p>The eight steps you&#8217;ve taken so far that start with choosing a cryonics company and end with you in the thermos only accomplish the first If, with all the other Ifs still standing in between you and the next step in your cryonics journey—revival.</p>
<p>To understand how we can reach that step, we need to understand the deal with all four Ifs.</p>
<p>We’ll start by talking about Ifs 1-3, which need to be discussed together, because they&#8217;re interdependent and they work together. To illustrate why, let&#8217;s lay them out in the same visual:</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-1.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-5058"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5058" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-1.png" alt="Three Segments" width="600" height="176" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-1.png 1700w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-1-300x88.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-1-768x226.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-1-600x176.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>The three segments of this line relate to Ifs 1, 2, and 3. But the visual is a little misleading at first, because even though all three segments lie on the same line, they&#8217;re all representing different concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The blue segment</strong> (If 1) represents <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the quality of your initial preservation</span>.</li>
<li><strong>The yellow segment</strong> (If 2) represents <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the capabilities of medical technology as time moves forward</span>.</li>
<li><strong>The green segment</strong> (If 3) represents <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the amount of time still needed to bridge the gap between the blue and yellow segments before they can finally connect to each other. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is that the better you were preserved, the farther out to the right the blue segment extends, and as technology gets better and better, the yellow segment extends itself farther and farther left toward the blue segment. The green segment gets smaller and smaller as this happens, until eventually the green segment is no more and the blue and yellow segments connect—i.e. medical technology has reached the point where it can revive you.</p>
<p>A lot of the key details about cryonics are centered here, so let’s talk about each of these segments in more depth:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The blue segment—the quality of your preservation (which relates to If 1)</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-Blue.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-5054"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5054" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-Blue.png" alt="Three Segments Blue" width="500" height="95" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-Blue.png 1510w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-Blue-300x57.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-Blue-768x146.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-Blue-600x114.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>The length of the blue segment corresponds to the <em>quality of preservation</em>. Or, put most simply, the fewer roadblocks there are between your vitrified state in the thermos and a fully restored and healthy you, the <em>longer</em> the blue segment is—because if everything that happens leading up to you being put in the thermos goes as well as possible, it goes a <em>longer way</em> towards getting you to Point B and means the yellow segment has to do less work on <em>its </em>end to be able to revive you.</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-comparison.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-5057"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5057" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-comparison.png" alt="Three Segments comparison" width="550" height="197" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-comparison.png 1500w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-comparison-300x107.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-comparison-768x275.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-comparison-600x215.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a></p>
<p>The major factor that determines the length of the blue segment is how closely the atomic structure of your vitrified brain resembles the original atomic structure of your brain when it was living and healthy.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s note that I said &#8220;brain,&#8221; not “body,” because what we mostly care about here is the brain. Cryonicists, like many of us, believe that who <em>you</em> are comes down to your brain. If, in the future, your identical current brain lived on top of a synthetic body and your exact memories and personality were fully intact, cryonicists would be satisfied that you “survived.” That&#8217;s why some don&#8217;t even bother vitrifying their body.</p>
<p>The second thing to note is that scientists believe that short-term memory is contained in brain <i>activity</i>—in the <i>electricity </i>going through your brain—while your long-term memory, your personality, your knowledge, and everything else that makes you “you” is contained in the brain’s <i>structure</i>—i.e. the particular arrangement of atoms that make up your brain.<a href="#footnote2-13-4836" id="note2-13-4836" rel="footnote2">13</a>
<p>Any electrical activity in your brain before legal death will be lost during vitrification, so you’d be revived without the short-term memory of the end of your pre-vitrified life. But what vitrification <i>can </i>preserve is the structure of your brain, which conveniently, is all we care about.</p>
<p>This concept gives us a clearer understanding of the way cryonicists view death. To cryonicists, perfect health means the exact arrangement of atoms in your healthy brain being intact, and the process of dying means the deterioration of that arrangement due to phenomena like aging, injury, disease, and, eventually, effects caused by heart stoppage. Death, to them, means the point at which the original structure of your brain has become <em>so</em> disorganized that even the fanciest future science lab would have no way of figuring out what the original arrangement looked like—that&#8217;s the definition of info death.</p>
<p>The concept of info death makes sense when we compare the brain to a computer&#8217;s hard drive. Eliezer Yudkowsky explains how difficult it actually is to bring a computer hard drive to info death:<a href="#footnote2-14-4836" id="note2-14-4836" rel="footnote2">14</a>
<p><em>If you want to securely erase a hard drive, it&#8217;s not as easy as writing it over with zeroes. Sure, an &#8220;erased&#8221; hard drive like this won&#8217;t boot up your computer if you just plug it in again. But if the drive falls into the hands of a specialist with a scanning tunneling microscope, they can tell the difference between &#8220;this was a 0, overwritten by a 0&#8221; and &#8220;this was a 1, overwritten by a 0&#8221;.</em></p>
<p><em>There are programs advertised to &#8220;securely erase&#8221; hard drives using many overwrites of 0s, 1s, and random data. But if you want to keep the secret on your hard drive secure against all possible future technologies that might ever be developed, then cover it with thermite and set it on fire. It&#8217;s the only way to be sure.</em></p>
<p>He applies the same logic to the human brain to suggest that cryonics patients should one day be revivable:</p>
<p><em>Pumping someone full of cryoprotectant and gradually lowering their temperature until they can be stored in liquid nitrogen is not a secure way to erase a person.</em></p>
<p>In other words, it&#8217;s reasonable to assume that the fanciest future neuroscientists will become <i>so </i>good at reading a damaged vitrified brain for clues as to its original structure that a typical combo of aging, disease, heart stoppage, and vitrification likely won&#8217;t be able to &#8220;stump&#8221; them. And to cryonicists, if future scientists can examine your vitrified brain and figure out what it&#8217;s supposed to look like, you&#8217;re not dead—by definition.</p>
<p>The length of the blue segment—preservation quality—is affected by three things:</p>
<p><strong>1) How much damage happened before you legally died. </strong>How old were you when you died? How much had your brain deteriorated by that point? Did you suffer from a dementia-causing disease like Alzheimer&#8217;s and how much permanent damage did that disease do?<a href="#footnote-3-4836" id="note-3-4836" rel="footnote">3</a> Did the thing that killed you damage your brain (like brain cancer, or a head injury) or was your brain unharmed?</p>
<p><strong>2) How much damage happened between when you legally died and when the cryonics team started working on you. </strong>In the ideal situation, your heart stops and before any changes happen in your brain, you&#8217;re stabilized and put on ice. Often, this isn&#8217;t how things go, and every unattended minute that passes after legal death has a big impact on the brain and shortens the length of the blue segment. But cryonicists believe that true info death doesn&#8217;t happen for many hours, or even days, after legal death occurs, and that there&#8217;s often hope in cryopreserving even people who lay &#8220;dead&#8221; for a while before being found.</p>
<p><strong>3) How much damage happened during the vitrifying process. </strong>Vitrification itself—at least the way it is currently done—causes its own damage to the brain. Cryonics research focuses mostly on mitigating this factor, and it&#8217;s dramatically improved since the earliest days in the 1970s—the series of images at the bottom of <a href="http://alcor.org/AboutCryonics/index.html" target="_blank">this page</a> shows the progress that has been made.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><span class="s1">The yellow segment—the state of medical technological advancement as time moves forward (which relates to If 2)</span></strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-Yellow.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-5055"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5055" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-Yellow.png" alt="Three Segments Yellow" width="500" height="86" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-Yellow.png 1562w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-Yellow-300x52.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-Yellow-768x132.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-Yellow-600x103.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As medical technology becomes more and more advanced, the yellow segment grows—but while the blue segment extends to the right as it grows, the yellow segment extends to the <em>left</em>. The key point happens when technology eventually gets so good that the yellow segment meets the blue segment and you become officially revivable. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some questions:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Will</i> If 2 happen? Will technology <em>ever</em> reach the point when it can revive you?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Assuming If 1 gets a check mark, cryonicists believe If 2 is likely to one day get a check mark too. Because there are only two ways to totally fail If 2:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1) For some reason, humans permanently stop working on medical technology advancements before you hit the If 2 key point.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2) Humans go extinct before hitting the If 2 key point.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Barring those two situations, If 2 should eventually cooperate. The theory is that with <i>enough</i> future technology, you&#8217;ll one day be revivable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>When</i> will If 2 happen? How long until I&#8217;m revived?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This part depends on how substantial the technological challenge of cryonic revival turns out to be and how quickly technology ends up moving forward—but it also depends upon how well If 1 went. As we just discussed, the better If 1 goes, the sooner If 2 happens.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>How </i>will If 2 happen? What kind of future technology might be able to revive vitrified people?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Well, it depends on what we mean by revival. Cryonicists seem to have a Plan A and a Plan B.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Plan A: Restore the vitrified patient as a healthy human</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Under Plan A, revival consists of restoring the structure of the vitrified brain to its original state—i.e. putting all the atoms where they belong. To do that, you need two things:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1) The info about where the atoms are supposed to go</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2) A way to put the atoms where they&#8217;re supposed to go</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first thing is taken care of if today&#8217;s vitrifying procedures do their job, assuming future neuroscientists become really good at deciphering a brain’s original state from the information they can gather by examining the vitrified brain. </span></p>
<p>The second thing requires <em>molecular nanotechnology</em>. For a quick nanotech overview, I&#8217;ll steal part of a blue box from the <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html" target="_blank">AI post</a>:</p>
<div class="wbwAside">
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Nanotechnology Blue Box</span></strong></p>
<p>Nanotechnology is our word for technology that deals with the manipulation of matter that&#8217;s between 1 and 100 nanometers in size. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter, or a millionth of a millimeter, and this 1-100 range encompasses viruses (100 nm across), DNA (10 nm wide), and things as small as large molecules like hemoglobin (5 nm) and medium molecules like glucose (1 nm). If/when we conquer nanotechnology, the next step will be the ability to manipulate individual atoms, which are only one order of magnitude smaller (~.1 nm).<a href="#footnote-4-4836" id="note-4-4836" rel="footnote">4</a>
<p>To understand the challenge of humans trying to manipulate matter in that range, let&#8217;s take the same thing on a larger scale. The International Space Station is 268 mi (431 km) above the Earth. If humans were giants so large their heads reached up to the ISS, they&#8217;d be about 250,000 times bigger than they are now. If you make the 1nm &#8211; 100nm nanotech range 250,000 times bigger, you get .25mm &#8211; 2.5cm. So nanotechnology is the equivalent of a human giant as tall as the ISS figuring out how to carefully build intricate objects using materials between the size of a grain of sand and an eyeball. To reach the next level—manipulating individual atoms—the giant would have to carefully position objects that are 1/40th of a millimeter—so small normal-size humans would need a microscope to see them.<a href="#footnote-5-4836" id="note-5-4836" rel="footnote">5</a>
<p>Nanotech was first discussed by Richard Feynman in a 1959 talk, when he explained: “The principles of physics, as far as I can see, do not speak against the possibility of maneuvering things atom by atom. It would be, in principle, possible … for a physicist to synthesize any chemical substance that the chemist writes down…. How? Put the atoms down where the chemist says, and so you make the substance.” It&#8217;s as simple as that. If you can figure out how to move individual molecules or atoms around, you can make literally anything. Nanotechnology so advanced that it allows us to engineer at an atomic level is called molecular nanotechnology (MNT).</p>
<p>Humans haven&#8217;t yet conquered MNT, and scientists debate how long it&#8217;ll take humanity to get there. But when we do, we might look back on today&#8217;s technology as terribly primitive, like the picture scientist Ralph Merkle <a href="http://www.zyvex.com/nano/" target="_blank">paints</a>: “Today&#8217;s manufacturing methods are very crude at the molecular level. Casting, grinding, milling and even lithography move atoms in great thundering statistical herds. It&#8217;s like trying to make things out of LEGO blocks with boxing gloves on your hands. Yes, you can push the LEGO blocks into great heaps and pile them up, but you can&#8217;t really snap them together the way you&#8217;d like.&#8221;</p>

<p>MNT will be a game-changer in an unimaginable number of arenas, one of which is in medicine. A brain synapse is just a particular configuration of atoms, so if we have the tools to move atoms around and put them where we want, then we can perfectly &#8220;repair&#8221; a damaged synapse. Cryonicists believe MNT is the key to the future revival and restoration of cryonics patients.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first thought some people have when they think about revival is that the person would be revived as the old and dying person they were before being vitrified. But that&#8217;s not the plan. When we get to the point when we have technology so incredible that we can move atoms around well enough to revive someone, we should also have the technology to repair and rejuvenate them. For someone who was dying of cancer before going into the thermos, not only will their successful revival mean that cancer has likely been conquered long ago, but probably aging too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Along the same lines, by that point we should also be able to either rejuvenate the patient&#8217;s vitrified body or simply make a new, perfectly-working body. Alcor&#8217;s Medical Response Director, Aaron Drake, explains: “We know we can regenerate a small organ, and grow a new heart. We know we can 3-dimensionally print cells and hearts. So at some point we would need to regenerate her entire body, or at least her organs, and put it all together. Then we’d need to transplant that brain into a new body.&#8221;<a href="#footnote2-15-4836" id="note2-15-4836" rel="footnote2">15</a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Plan B: Upload the person’s brain info into a virtual world</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Plan B shares Plan A&#8217;s first requirement—the info about where the atoms are supposed to go—but not its need for physical assembly. Instead, Plan B relies on a hypothetical future technology called &#8220;whole brain emulation,” where an entire brain structure can be uploaded to a computer with such perfect accuracy that everything about the person is intact and alive in a virtual world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sounds super fun, right?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is an option if physical revival is too difficult, or if it&#8217;s so far in the future that the physical world has actually gone out of style entirely. If humans can somehow pull off whole brain emulation, you could be revived to wake up in a magical virtual world, fully conscious and no longer confined to the limits and vulnerabilities of biology and the physical world. Please.</span></p>
<p class="p1">While both Plan A and B require immense technological hurdles, cryonicists stress that both options are theoretically possible.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><span class="s1">The green segment—the amount of time you need to stay safely in storage before technology is able to revive you (which relates to If 3)</span></strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-Green-1.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-5059"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5059" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-Green-1.png" alt="Three Segments Green" width="500" height="91" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-Green-1.png 1555w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-Green-1-300x54.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-Green-1-768x139.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Three-Segments-Green-1-600x109.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The green segment&#8217;s job is simple: hold everything together until the yellow segment connects to the blue segment. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So what could mess up If 3? What could sabotage a vitrified person&#8217;s ability to remain bathed in liquid nitrogen as long as necessary? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A lot of things. Like:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The cryonics company screws up. </b>A human-error-caused catastrophe—e.g. a rupture in a thermos tank lets in heat, and all the liquid nitrogen evaporates before the staff realizes what happened.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The cryonics company goes bankrupt and doesn&#8217;t have the means, the will, or the organization to create a plan that will save the patients. </b>I mentioned that this happened a few times with some of the earlier companies. The major companies today claim to have secure backup plans in place in case of the worst case scenario, and this security blanket is the main purpose of Alcor’s sizable trust.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>A natural disaster.</b> An earthquake, tornado, or something else smashes the building holding the thermoses to oblivion. Neither major US cryonics company is in a location highly prone to natural disasters—Alcor actually located itself in Scottsdale, AZ because it is the place in the US </span><span class="s2"><a href="http://www.alcor.org/AboutAlcor/scottsdale.html" target="_blank">least at risk</a></span><span class="s1"> of natural disasters. Even if a natural disaster were to strike, the patients might be fine—the thermoses are strong, they&#8217;re power-outage-proof with no electricity involved, and even if a thermos is ruptured, there&#8217;s the upside-down thing where patients&#8217; heads will be the last body part affected.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>A terrorist attack on a cryonics facility. </b>There are a lot of people in the world—especially in the world of religion—who hate the concept of cryonics.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>War. </b>All bets are off in war.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The law prevents the cryonics company from doing its job. </b>This one almost happened recently. In 2004, Arizona legislators tried to pass a bill that would have put Alcor under the regulation of the State Funeral Board. This, if passed, would have likely ended up shutting Alcor down. It turned into a nasty debate, centered largely around religious issues, with the religious voice disapproving of Alcor&#8217;s line of work—but ultimately, Alcor prevailed. That said, in order to do business legally, Alcor has to accept bodies in the guise of &#8220;anatomical donations for research purposes,” a practice protected by the constitutional right to donate one&#8217;s body for research into cryopreservation. The law-related variable seems pretty stable currently, but if someone has a long green segment and requires 800 years of storage before their revival becomes possible, who the hell knows what will happen—what is currently Scottsdale, AZ might not even be part of the US by that point.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The cryonics company comes under ownership with different values and they decide to give up on the patients. </b>Or, more maliciously, a cryonics-hater makes a too-good-to-refuse offer to the owners of a cryonics company with the intention of shutting it down. All major cryonics companies claim that they&#8217;re run and always will be run by passionate cryonicists and this is not a possibility—but again, who knows.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The longer the green segment is and the longer it needs to hold out, the higher the chance of failing If 3. If patients can be revived 40 years from now, there&#8217;s a lot less that can go wrong than if revival doesn&#8217;t become possible for 2,500 years. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the companies are doing their best to plan for the long run. On the question of how long until revival becomes possible, Alcor says, “Some think it will take centuries before patients can be revived, while others think the accelerating pace of technological change might so rapidly transform our world that decades would suffice. Alcor is planning for however long it might take.”<a href="#footnote2-16-4836" id="note2-16-4836" rel="footnote2">16</a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As time moves forward and both vitrification and revival technology improve, both the blue and yellow segments will tend to move inward, invading the green segment from both sides. The big picture might be best illustrated like this:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cryonics-big-picture-4.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-5069"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5069" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cryonics-big-picture-4.png" alt="Cryonics big picture" width="650" height="511" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cryonics-big-picture-4.png 1471w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cryonics-big-picture-4-300x236.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cryonics-big-picture-4-768x604.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cryonics-big-picture-4-600x472.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is how the blue, green and yellow segments work in flow with each other. Cryonics companies often say cryonics will be a &#8220;last in, first out&#8221; thing, and this graph shows exactly why—</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cryonics-big-picture-2-2.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-5067"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5067" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cryonics-big-picture-2-2.png" alt="Cryonics big picture 2" width="700" height="700" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cryonics-big-picture-2-2.png 1500w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cryonics-big-picture-2-2-150x150.png 150w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cryonics-big-picture-2-2-300x300.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cryonics-big-picture-2-2-768x768.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cryonics-big-picture-2-2-600x600.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The more time that passes before you need to be vitrified, the fancier the vitrification technology you&#8217;ll be treated with <em>and</em> the further along revival technology will be—and this smaller technology gap will mean a sooner revival date. And with less time to have to rely on a cryonics company to care for you, the less risk you&#8217;ll be taking. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It&#8217;s important to understand that the blue line on the graph applies to the <em>average</em> cryonics patient—someone who suffers from Alzheimers late in life will go into vitrification in worse shape than a typical person of their time, so their particular challenge will be greater than the blue line height that corresponds with the year of their death.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, the simple, straight lines on the graph are portraying the general concept. The actual lines won&#8217;t be straight or predictable. One promising way this might be the case is that the accelerating rate of technological advancement<a href="#footnote-6-4836" id="note-6-4836" rel="footnote">6</a> might mean that the blue and yellow lines could improve at a faster rate over time and look like this:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cryonics-big-picture-Exponential.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-5060"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5060" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cryonics-big-picture-Exponential.png" alt="Cryonics big picture Exponential" width="650" height="576" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cryonics-big-picture-Exponential.png 1306w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cryonics-big-picture-Exponential-300x266.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cryonics-big-picture-Exponential-768x680.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cryonics-big-picture-Exponential-600x532.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p>So that&#8217;s how the first three Ifs work. And that&#8217;s all great—but none of it matters if If 4 doesn’t pan out. Without If 4—i.e. &#8220;Will people actually revive me when the time comes?&#8221;—you&#8217;re still just a helpless, vitrified body, and if the external world doesn’t keep their side of the bargain once you become revivable, you’re out of luck—and you’ll never know it happened.</p>
<p>You’ll be a little like a farm animal. You might have rights in theory, but with no ability to defend your own rights, you’ll rely on other people to fight for those rights on your behalf.</p>
<p>As I’ve dug into this topic and talked to people about it, I’ve noticed that this concern seems to jump immediately to people’s minds as a reason cryonics is unlikely to work out.</p>
<p>They ask: “There will be enough problems on Earth to deal with—do you really think people are going to care about bringing dead people back to life?”</p>
<p>Cryonicists have answers to this question.</p>
<p>First, they point out that patients won&#8217;t be floating in tanks in a world that has forgotten them. Rather, as a patient, you’d likely have A) descendants or friends who will be highly aware of you and eager to see you reanimated, B) the larger cryonicist community, who will be as passionately interested in your fair treatment as PETA activists are in the fair treatment of animals, and C) the contractual obligation of your future care-takers—similar to how today you might be operated on by a surgeon who doesn’t know you, but who diligently cares for you anyway out of professional obligation.</p>
<p>Second, they argue that once the revival of cryonics patients becomes a reality, the public’s conception of what a cryonics patient is and what she deserves will dramatically shift:<a href="#footnote2-17-4836" id="note2-17-4836" rel="footnote2">17</a>
<p><i>Long before it ever becomes possible to contemplate revival of today&#8217;s patients, reversible suspended animation will be perfected as a mainstream medical technology. From that point forward, the whole tradition of caring for people who cannot immediately be fixed will be strongly reinforced in culture and law. By the time it becomes possible to revive patients preserved with the oldest and crudest technologies, revival from states of suspended animation will be something that has been done thousands, if not millions, of times before. The moral and cultural imperative for revival when possible will be as basic and strong as the obligation to render first aid and emergency medical care today.</i></p>
<p>If a cryonics patient might seem to have the rights of a farm animal today, cryonicists expect that to become an outdated and primitive-seeming viewpoint down the road. They believe cryonics patients will be looked upon more like today&#8217;s coma patients.</p>
<p>That sounds great, but of course, we have no idea how the future will play out or what the standing will be for the field of cryonics and its suspended patients. It does seem plausible, at least, that cryonics patients will end up with more and more rights in the future, not fewer and fewer. If that&#8217;s what happens, If 4 shouldn&#8217;t be much of a problem.</p>
<p>And if all four Ifs go your way, you&#8217;ll finally be able to move onto the next step—the one that will really blow your mind when it happens.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Step 9) Be revived</strong></span></p>
<p>This will be quite the experience.</p>
<p>First, whether it happens 30 years or 2,000 years after you were last conscious, it&#8217;ll feel the same to you—probably a bit like a short nap. When you sleep, you feel the passage of time—when you wake up after an eight-hour night&#8217;s sleep, it doesn&#8217;t feel like you just went to bed a second ago, it feels like it&#8217;s been eight hours. But being on pause in your liquid nitrogen thermos is different. You won&#8217;t experience the passage of time, so it&#8217;ll feel like you were <em>just </em>awake in your previous life (the only reason it won&#8217;t feel totally instantaneous is that you&#8217;ll have lost your short term memories). You&#8217;ll probably be super disoriented, and someone will have to explain to you that A) you&#8217;re in the future, and B) the cryonics worked, and you&#8217;re no longer a person about to die—you&#8217;re healthy and rejuvenated and all set to start living again.</p>
<p>How <em>intense</em>.</p>
<p>As a very not-heaven-believing person, I&#8217;ve always thought about how <em>pleasantly shocked </em>I would be if I died and then woke up in some delightful afterlife. I&#8217;d look around, slowly realize what was happening, and then I&#8217;d be like, &#8220;Wait&#8230;<em>NO FUCKING WAY</em>.&#8221; Then I&#8217;d promptly plant myself at the gates and watch other atheists come in for the fun of seeing them go through the same shock.</p>
<p>I imagine being revived from cryonics will be kind of like that. Maybe a <em>few</em> notches less shocking, since you presumably did the cryonics thing because you thought there was a chance it would work—but still a pretty big <em>no fucking way </em>moment.</p>
<p>After the initial shock, you&#8217;ll have to figure out what kind of world you&#8217;ve woken up into. Some possibilities:</p>
<p><strong>It could suck<em>. </em></strong>You could wake up in a far future world that&#8217;s a lot worse than the one you previously lived in and a world in which you know zero people. Even worse, you could wake up in some really scary situation—who knows what kind of creepy shit might be going on in the future.</p>
<p><strong>It could be blah. </strong>You could wake up in a world that&#8217;s kind of meh. Like it&#8217;s not as future-y and cool as you thought it would be and you&#8217;re not immortal, just somewhat restored and still vulnerable, and you have to get a job and you don&#8217;t really have applicable skills for the times. Just kind of whatevs.</p>
<p><strong>It could be incredibly rad. </strong>Probably the most likely outcome, you could wake up and it could be very, very rad. The future-y stuff might be cool and fun beyond your comprehension. You might have previously been 84 and aching everywhere and forgetful, and suddenly you have the body of a perfectly fit 20-year-old, or maybe something even better, like a super-charged synthetic body that doesn&#8217;t feel pain or exhaustion and can&#8217;t get sick. Your old, forgetful brain could be repaired and full of vitality you haven&#8217;t experienced in 50 years. And best, you might be surrounded by friends and family who were also cryopreserved and are <em>unbelievably </em>excited to see you. It could be rad.</p>
<p>It could be even crazier if you wake up in a virtual world after having had your vitrified brain data uploaded to a computer. You wouldn&#8217;t feel like you were in a computer—you&#8217;d feel every bit as real as you did when you were a human, except now everything is amazing and magical and you can spend almost all your time fulfilling my lifelong dream of sliding down rainbows like this care bear.<a href="#footnote2-18-4836" id="note2-18-4836" rel="footnote2">18</a>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/28395ff72b29fb268c0cfd4a43433490.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-5037"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5037 size-full" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/28395ff72b29fb268c0cfd4a43433490.jpg" alt="28395ff72b29fb268c0cfd4a43433490" width="236" height="261" /></a></p>
<p>Your friends and family could be there with you, also virtually uploaded but still fully themselves with all of their old memories—all of you now eternal and indestructible, with no need for the physical world or its resources.</p>
<p>Who knows what kind of world you&#8217;d wake up in. But a couple things lead me to believe it would be a pretty good situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>A really terrible future world probably isn&#8217;t the type of world that would be concerned with protecting and reviving cryonics patients. In a world like that, you&#8217;d probably just never wake up.</li>
<li>Likewise, a future that can revive vitrified people is by definition pretty technologically amazing, so it&#8217;s hard to imagine waking up in a world that hasn&#8217;t solved all kinds of problems our current world suffers from.</li>
<li>The future tends to be better than the past. Humans have the tendency to predict dystopian futures, but at least so far, it&#8217;s been the other way around. Say what you want about the ills of today&#8217;s world, but it&#8217;s better to be a human today than it was 200 or 1,000 or 10,000 years ago.</li>
</ul>
<p>But because we have no idea what revival will be like, we have this next step:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Step 10) Decide if you&#8217;re into it and want to stay</strong></span></p>
<p>Barring some hilariously bad scenario where you&#8217;re revived into a world of eternal virtual torture with no ability to end it—which really makes no sense—cryonics is a risk-free venture. It has an undo button—just kill yourself and it&#8217;s as if it never happened. If you&#8217;re not into it, your journey ends here. Otherwise, move on to the next step.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Step 11) Enjoy shit</strong></span></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve kind of reached the end of me guiding you. You&#8217;re now just living again like you were before—hopefully in a much better situation—and what you do at this point is really your business. Just go do your thing and enjoy being in the future.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Step 12) Die for real this time</strong></span></p>
<p>At some point, you&#8217;ll be over it. No one ever will ever ever want to live forever, a fact I realized at the end of my <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/11/1000000-grahams-number.html" target="_blank">Graham&#8217;s Number post</a>. When the time comes, I assume the fancy future will have some painless way to bow out—something that will cause total info death, where your data is truly unrecoverable. At that point, you&#8217;ll have lived the complete life you want to live, not a life cut short by the limitations of the medical technology of the time you happen to be born in. That&#8217;s really the way things should be.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p>Now that we all know a lot more about cryonics, let&#8217;s bring back our sentence. This is where we were, and we were looking closely at the three words in the red:</p>
<p><strong>Cryonics is the morbid process of <span style="color: #ff0000;">freezing rich, dead</span> people who can&#8217;t accept the concept of death, in the hopes that people from the future will be able to bring them back to life, and the community of hard-core cryonics people might also be a Scientology-like cult.</strong></p>
<p>We can get rid of &#8220;rich,&#8221; because at least for younger people, cryonics can be paid for with a not-that-expensive life insurance plan.</p>
<p>We can get rid of &#8220;dead,&#8221; because cryonics doesn&#8217;t deal with dead people, it deals with people currently doomed to die given the technology they have current access to. For the same reason, we can also change the wording of &#8220;bring them back to life.&#8221;</p>
<p>And we can get rid of &#8220;freezing,&#8221; because cryonics doesn&#8217;t freeze people—it vitrifies them into an amorphous solid state.</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re here, let&#8217;s get rid of &#8220;morbid.&#8221; Is a vitrified human head floating in liquid nitrogen morbid? Yes. Is it more morbid than being eaten by worms and microbes underground or being burned to ashes? Definitely not. So not a fair word to use.</p>
<p>So that leaves us with a sentence more like this:</p>
<p><strong>Cryonics is the process of pausing people in critical condition who can&#8217;t accept the concept of death, in the hopes that people from the future will be able to save them, and the community of hard-core cryonics people might also be a Scientology-like cult.</strong></p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the elephant in the room—this part of the sentence: <em>&#8230;and the community of hard-core cryonics people might also be a Scientology-like cult.</em></p>
<p>I put that in there because when you&#8217;re examining something that involves A) a fringe community, B) the possible concept of immortality, and C) members paying large sums of money for services that they&#8217;re told might pan out 1,000 years from now—you have no choice but to put up your &#8220;Is this a Scientology-y thing?&#8221; antenna.</p>
<p>One way to let that antenna do its work is to read a bunch of stuff written by smart, credible people who think the whole thing is utter BS. If anything will disenchant you to the excitement of something as out there as cryonics, it&#8217;s experts telling you why it should be ignored.</p>
<p>So I did that. And as I read, I weighed what I read against the rebuttal from cryonicists, which I&#8217;d often find on Alcor&#8217;s highly comprehensive <a href="http://www.alcor.org/FAQs/" target="_blank">FAQ page</a>. Other resources for the cryonicist viewpoint are the thorough <a href="http://www.benbest.com/cryonics/CryoFAQ.html" target="_blank">FAQ</a> of the Cryonics Institute&#8217;s ex-president, Ben Best, Alcor&#8217;s <a href="http://www.alcor.org/sciencefaq.htm" target="_blank">Science FAQ</a> and Alcor&#8217;s <a href="http://www.alcor.org/cryomyths.html" target="_blank">Myths page</a>.</p>
<p>The people who are super not into cryonics fall into a few general buckets:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Skeptic Type 1: The scientist with a valid argument about why cryonics might not be possible</strong></span></p>
<p>The mainstream medical community is generally not on board with cryonics. No health insurance company will cover it, no government will subsidize it, no doctors will refer to it as a medical procedure.</p>
<p>Some skeptics make what seem to be valid points. Biochemist Ken Storey <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/0/23695785" target="_blank">says</a>, &#8220;We have many different organs and we know from research into preserving transplant organs that even if it were possible to successfully cryopreserve them, each would need to be cooled at a different rate and with a different mixture and concentration of cryoprotectants. Even if you only wanted to preserve the brain, it has dozens of different areas, which would need to be cryopreserved using different protocols.&#8221; Storey also points out just how tall an order it would be to &#8220;repair&#8221; someone damaged by vitrification, explaining that &#8220;a human cell has around 50,000 proteins and hundreds of millions of fat molecules that make up the membranes. Cryopreservation disrupts all of them.&#8221; (Alcor calls this statement <a href="http://www.alcor.org/notablequotes.html" target="_blank">patently false</a>.<a href="#footnote-7-4836" id="note-7-4836" rel="footnote">7</a>)</p>
<p>Others point to the towering challenge of either repairing a human brain or scanning one in order to upload it. Brazilian scientist Miguel Nicolelis <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/quest-upload-mind-into-digital-space-180954946/?no-ist" target="_blank">emphasizes</a> that the task of scanning a human brain would require, with today’s technology, “a million electron microscopes running in parallel for ten years.” Michael Hendricks, who studies the brains of roundworms, believes the challenge of reviving the qualities that make someone who they are is far too complex to achieve, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/541311/the-false-science-of-cryonics/" target="_blank">explaining</a> that &#8220;while it might be theoretically possible to preserve these features in dead tissue, that certainly is not happening now. The technology to do so, let alone the ability to read this information back out of such a specimen, does not yet exist even in principle.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Cryonicist response: Totes</strong></span></p>
<p>Cryonicists don&#8217;t really disagree with these people (Storey&#8217;s quote notwithstanding). They readily admit that the challenges of reviving someone from cryopreservation are insurmountable using today&#8217;s technology. They simply point out that A) there&#8217;s no scientific evidence that cryonics <em>can&#8217;t </em>work, B) we shouldn&#8217;t underestimate what future technology will be able to do (imagine how mind-blowing <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/07/crispr-dna-editing-2/" target="_blank">CRISPR</a> would be to someone in the year 1700 and think about what the equivalent would be for us), and C) there have been some promising developments—like the recent <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/332074-cryonics-rabbit-brain-regenerated/" target="_blank">well-preserved vitrified rabbit brain</a> news—that suggest there&#8217;s reason for optimism.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m yet to hear a cryonicist say, &#8220;Cryonics will work.&#8221; They just don&#8217;t feel that this is a case where a lack of proof amounts to a lack of credibility. Alcor&#8217;s Science FAQ <a href="http://www.alcor.org/sciencefaq.htm" target="_blank">addresses</a> this: &#8220;The burden of proof lies with those who make a claim that is inconsistent with existing well-established scientific theory. Cryonics is not inconsistent with well-established scientific theory &#8230; At no point does cryonics require that existing physical law be altered in any way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cryonicists also don&#8217;t waste an opportunity to point out these quotes:</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no hope for the fanciful idea of reaching the Moon because of insurmountable barriers to escaping the Earth&#8217;s gravity.&#8221; — Dr. Forest Ray Moulton, University of Chicago astronomer, 1932.</p>
<p>&#8220;All this writing about space travel is utter bilge.&#8221; — Sir Richard Woolley, Astronomer Royal of Britain, 1956</p>
<p>&#8220;To place a man in a multi-stage rocket and project him into the controlling gravitational field of the moon&#8230;. I am bold enough to say that such a man-made voyage will never occur regardless of all future advances.&#8221; — Dr. Lee De Forest, famous engineer, 1957</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Skeptic Type 2: The scientist who argues that cryonics won&#8217;t work even though they know less about cryonics than you do right now having read this post</span></strong></p>
<p>This is a surprisingly large category of cryonics skeptics. It&#8217;s amazing, for example, how many people from the mainstream medical world argue that cryonics can&#8217;t work because when water freezes, it causes irreparable damage to human tissue.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Cryonicist response: Agreed—that&#8217;s why we don&#8217;t freeze people. Please read about what cryonics is before saying more words out of your mouth.</strong></span></p>
<p>Among the cryonics skeptics who literally don&#8217;t get what modern cryonics consists of is celebrity physicist Michio Kaku, someone I normally like, but who in this clip is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-tcfWnZgCo" target="_blank">taken to town</a> by Alcor&#8217;s CEO for having no idea what he&#8217;s talking about.</p>
<p>Part of the reason most scientists don&#8217;t get cryonics has to do with its cross-disciplinary nature. Alcor explains:</p>
<p><em>Most experts in any single field will say that they know of no evidence that cryonics can work. That&#8217;s because cryonics is an interdisciplinary field based on <a href="http://www.alcor.org/AboutCryonics/index.html" target="_blank">three facts</a> from diverse unrelated sciences. Without all these facts, cryonics seems ridiculous. Unfortunately that makes the number of experts qualified to comment on cryonics very small. For example, very few scientists even know what vitrification is. Fewer still know that vitrification can preserve cell structure of <a href="http://www.alcor.org/cryomyths.html#myth2" target="_blank">whole organs</a> or <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15247086" target="_blank">whole brains</a>. Even though this use of vitrification has been published, it is so uncommon outside of cryonics that only a handful of cryobiologists know it is possible.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Skeptic Type 3: The cryo<em>gen</em>icist who doesn&#8217;t want the other cool kids to think he&#8217;s friends with cryonics, the weird outsider.</strong></span></p>
<p>There&#8217;s an amusing little one-way rivalry going on between cryogenicists (who, remember, deal with the science of the effects of cold temperatures in general) and cryonicists. Cryogenicists tend to view cryonics like an astronomer would view astrology—or at least, that&#8217;s what they say publicly out of caution. They seem to sometimes admit that there could be sound science behind cryonics, but they also know that cryonics lacks credibility with the wider science community and they don&#8217;t want to get roped into that reputation problem by association (they also have <a href="https://www.cryogenicsociety.org/cryonics/" target="_blank">very little sense of humor</a> about people confusing the words cryogenics and cryonics).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Cryonicist response: Whatevs.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Skeptic Type 4: The person who believes that even if you can revive a vitrified person, it won&#8217;t really be <em>them</em>.</strong></span></p>
<p>This relates to a philosophical quandary I explored in the post <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/what-makes-you-you.html" target="_blank">What Makes You You?</a> Are &#8220;you&#8221; your body? Your brain? The data in your brain? Something less tangible like a soul? This all becomes highly relevant when we&#8217;re thinking about cryonics. It&#8217;s hard to read about cryonic revival, and especially the prospect of &#8220;waking up&#8221; in a virtual world you&#8217;ve been uploaded into, without asking, &#8220;But wait&#8230;will that still be <em>me</em>?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a common objection to cryonics, but few people will argue with conviction that they <em>know </em>the answer to this question one way or the other.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Cryonicist response: </strong><strong>Yeah, we&#8217;re not sure about that either. Fingers crossed though.</strong></span></p>
<p>Most cryonicists have a hunch that <em>you </em>can survive cryopreservation intact (cryonicist Eliezer Yudkowsky argues that &#8220;successful cryonics preserves anything about you that is preserved by going to sleep at night and waking up the next morning”) but they also admit that this is yet another variable they&#8217;re not sure about. You might even want to consider this a fifth &#8220;If&#8221; to add onto our list: If what seems to be a revived me is <em>actually</em> me&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Skeptic Type 5: The person who, regardless of whether cryonics can work or not, thinks it&#8217;s a bad thing</strong></span></p>
<p>There are lots of these people. A handful of examples:</p>
<p><strong>Argument: </strong>Cryonics is icky.</p>
<p><strong>Typical cryonicist response: </strong>Yup, but less icky than decaying underground.</p>
<p><strong>Argument: </strong>Cryonics is creepy and unnatural.</p>
<p><strong>Typical cryonicist response:</strong> People said the same thing about the first organ transplants.</p>
<p><strong>Argument: </strong>Cryonics is trying to play God and cheat death.</p>
<p><strong>Typical cryonicist response: </strong>Is resuscitating someone whose heart has stopped playing God and cheating death? How about chemotherapy?</p>
<p><strong>Argument: </strong>Cryonics is a scam.</p>
<p><strong>Typical cryonicist response: </strong>The major cryonics companies are all nonprofits, the employees are paid modestly and the board members running the company (who are all signed up for cryonics themselves) aren&#8217;t paid at all. So who exactly is benefiting from this scam?</p>
<p><strong>Argument: </strong>&#8220;If you have enough money [for cryonics], then you have enough money to help somebody in need today.&#8221; — Bioethicist Kenneth Goodman<a href="#footnote2-19-4836" id="note2-19-4836" rel="footnote2">19</a>
<p><strong>Actual cryonicist response: </strong>&#8220;If you have enough money for health insurance (which costs a lot more than cryonics), then you have enough money to help somebody else in need today. In fact, if you have enough money for any discretionary expenditure (travel, sports, movies, beer), then you have enough money to help somebody in need today. Of all the ways people choose to spend substantial sums of money over a lifetime, singling out the health care choice of cryonics as selfish is completely arbitrary.&#8221;<a href="#footnote2-20-4836" id="note2-20-4836" rel="footnote2">20</a>
<p><strong>Argument: </strong>&#8220;Money invested to preserve human life in the deep freeze is money wasted, the sums involved being large enough to fulfill a punitive function as a self-imposed fine for gullibility and vanity.&#8221; — Biologist Jean Medawar<a href="#footnote2-21-4836" id="note2-21-4836" rel="footnote2">21</a>
<p><strong>Actual cryonicist response: </strong>&#8220;Nobody would ever imagine calling the first recipients of bone marrow transplants or artificial hearts &#8220;gullible and vain&#8221;. And what of dying children who are cryopreserved? Cryonics is an experiment, and people who choose this experiment are worthy of the same respect as other participants in high risk medical endeavors.&#8221;<a href="#footnote2-22-4836" id="note2-22-4836" rel="footnote2">22</a>
<p><strong>Argument: </strong>Cryonics will cause an overpopulation disaster.</p>
<p><strong>Actual cryonicist response: </strong>This is a common one I&#8217;ve heard in my discussions. Here&#8217;s what Alcor says: &#8220;What about antibiotics, vaccinations, statin drugs and the population pressures they bring? It&#8217;s silly to single out something as small and speculative as cryonics as a population issue. Life spans will continue increasing in developed parts of the world, cryonics or not, as they have done for the past century. Historically, as societies become more wealthy and long-lived, population takes care of itself. Couples have fewer children at later ages. This is happening in the world right now. The worst population problems are where people are poor and life spans short, not long.&#8221;<a href="#footnote2-23-4836" id="note2-23-4836" rel="footnote2">23</a>
<p><strong>Argument: </strong>But Ted Williams.</p>
<p>Let me explain. There are a handful of famous people signed up for cryonics, like Ray Kurzweil, nanotech pioneer Eric Drexler, and celebrities like Larry King, Britney Spears, Simon Cowell, and Paris Hilton.<a href="#footnote2-24-4836" id="note2-24-4836" rel="footnote2">24</a> But there are very few big names among the 300 or so who are already vitrified. One that is is baseball legend Ted Williams.</p>
<p>Williams is the first thing that comes to mind when a lot of people think about cryonics, an unfortunate fact that cryonicists wish would go away, because his story is <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ted-williams-frozen-in-two-pieces/" target="_blank">mired in scandal</a> (two of Williams&#8217; children said cryonics is what he wanted while the other claimed he wanted to be cremated and the son was just cryopreserving him so he could later profit off of his DNA samples). The ugly story ended up, fairly or unfairly, as a stain on the cryonics industry in many people&#8217;s heads, partially because in the midst of it, Sports Illustrated published an <a href="http://www.si.com/vault/2003/08/18/348299/what-really-happened-to-ted-williams-a-year-after-the-jarring-news-that-the-splendid-splinter-was-being-frozen-in-a-cryonics-lab-new-details-including-a-decapitation-suggest-that-one-of-americas-greatest-heroes-may-never-rest-in" target="_blank">article</a> about the scandal with quotes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Johnson_(author)" target="_blank">an ex-Alcor employee</a> accusing Alcor of mismanaging the Williams vitrification, among other things.</p>
<p><strong>Typical cryonicist response: </strong>Unfairly. It&#8217;s a stain unfairly. The accusations weren&#8217;t based in reality, and the employee recently <a href="http://www.alcor.org/press/response.html" target="_blank">admitted in court</a> that what he said may not have been true.</p>
<p><strong>Argument: </strong>Life is long enough. People aren&#8217;t supposed to live longer than we do now. Just enjoy what you&#8217;ve got.</p>
<p><strong>Typical cryonicist response: </strong>Thank you for your opinion. I disagree.</p>
<p>So how does my Scientology antenna feel after reading about 50 skeptic opinions?</p>
<p>Well, the skeptics definitely helped me appreciate the magnitude of the challenge at hand with cryonics. Science has a long way to go before cryonics can truly function as a pause button instead of a stop button—and we may never get there.</p>
<p>But it left me feeling every bit as confident that cryonics is a worthy pursuit and possibly a total game-changer. The fact that cryonic revival seems plausible, coupled with the fact that through most of history, the people of the time couldn&#8217;t have even imagined the magic that future technology would make real, makes me feel like the safer bet is on cryonics eventually <em>working</em>. If something important isn&#8217;t <em>impossible</em>, the future will probably figure out a way to make it happen, with enough time.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the &#8220;why the fuck not?&#8221; argument cryonicists make that&#8217;s very hard for skeptics to thwart.</p>
<p>Pro-cryonics scientist Ralph Merkle says it well:<a href="#footnote2-25-4836" id="note2-25-4836" rel="footnote2">25</a>
<p><em> The correct scientific answer to the question &#8220;Does cryonics work?&#8221; is: &#8220;The clinical trials are in progress. Come back in a century and we&#8217;ll give you an answer based on the outcome.&#8221; The relevant question for those of us who don&#8217;t expect to live that long is: &#8220;Would I rather be in the control group, or the experimental group?&#8221; We are forced by circumstances to answer that question without the benefit of knowing the results of the clinical trials.</em></p>
<p>The only way to shoot down a response that says, &#8220;We don&#8217;t know but we might as well try&#8221; is to say, &#8220;There is <em>definitely </em>no point in trying because it&#8217;s <em>impossible.</em>&#8221; And very few credible scientists would claim to have that conviction about things as mysterious as the workings of the brain and the possibilities of the far future.</p>
<p>The other thing that struck me as I learned about cryonics is that cryonicists aren&#8217;t usually &#8220;salesy&#8221; at all when they talk about cryonics. The impression I got from my research is that cryonicists tend to be well-educated, rational, realistic, and humble about what they know and don&#8217;t know. They readily admit the <a href="http://www.alcor.org/problems.html" target="_blank">problems and shortcomings</a> of the field<a href="#footnote-8-4836" id="note-8-4836" rel="footnote">8</a> and they&#8217;re careful to use measured, responsible language so as not to distort the nuances of the truth.<a href="#footnote-9-4836" id="note-9-4836" rel="footnote">9</a> And despite a general lack of support from the mainstream medical community, <a href="http://www.evidencebasedcryonics.org/scientists-open-letter-on-cryonics/" target="_blank">plenty of reputable scientists</a> have become fervent cryonicists.</p>
<p>So, for now, cryonics has satisfied my Scientology antenna.</p>
<p>Which shortens our sentence to this:</p>
<p><strong>Cryonics is the process of pausing people in critical condition who can&#8217;t accept the concept of death, in the hopes that people from the future will be able to save them.</strong></p>
<p>The final wording in the sentence that I&#8217;d like to challenge is:</p>
<p><strong>Cryonics is the process of pausing people in critical condition <span style="color: #ff0000;">who can&#8217;t accept the concept of death</span>, in the hopes that people from the future will be able to save them.</strong></p>
<p>This is the part of the sentence that carries a twinge of eye-rolling contempt—something people often feel when they hear about someone with a desire to conquer mortality. Aside from the aversion we have to the prospect of a human body floating in a freezing tank, many of us feel a distaste towards the <em>motivation behind </em>cryonics. It seems <em>greedy</em> to want more than your one standard life.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not one to typically feel contempt at something like this, but early in my research, even I found myself doing a little head shake when I read about billionaire Peter Thiel signing up for cryonics a while back.</p>
<p>But this post has forced me to take a big step back—back to where I can see death not as a moment but as a process, back to where I can see the human lifespan as a product of our times, not our biology, and back to where I see the concept of human health spread out along the spans of time and where I can imagine how future humans will see our current times of helplessness in the face of biological deterioration.</p>
<p>From way out here, it hits you that we&#8217;re living in a phase—a sad little window that an intelligent species inevitably passes through, when they&#8217;re advanced enough to understand their own mortality, but still too primitive to save themselves from it. We grapple with this by treating death like a tyrannical overlord we wouldn&#8217;t dare try to challenge, not even in our own private thoughts. We&#8217;ve been universally defeated and dominated by this overlord for as long as we&#8217;ve existed, and all we know how to do is bow down to it in full resignation of its power over us.<a href="#footnote-10-4836" id="note-10-4836" rel="footnote">10</a>
<p>Future humans who have one day overthrown the overlord will look at the phase we&#8217;re in and our resulting psychological condition with such clarity—they&#8217;ll be sad for us the way we&#8217;re sad for brainwashed members of an ancient cult who commit mass suicide because the master has instructed it.</p>
<p>Our will isn&#8217;t broken when it comes to <em>resisting </em>the overlord—that&#8217;s why we see it as honorable to fight cancer till the final minute, heroic to risk your own life for a good cause and make it out alive, and a terrible mistake to resign to the overlord prematurely and commit suicide.</p>
<p>But when it comes to <em>defeating </em>the overlord, our will has been squashed by a history that tells us that the overlord is indestructible.</p>
<p>And this explains the divide between how cryonicists feel about cryonics and how the rest of us view it. The divide is for two reasons:</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Cryonicists view death as a process and consider many people who are declared dead today to still be alive—and they view cryonics as an attempted transfer of a living patient to a future hospital that can save his life. In other words, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they view cryonics merely as an attempt to <em>resist</em> the overlord</span>, no different than the way we view someone being transferred to a hospital in a different location which has better treatment options for their condition. Most of us, by contrast, view death as a singular moment, so we see cryonics as an attempt to bring a dead person <em>back to life</em>—i.e. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we see cryonics as an attempt to <em>defeat</em> the overlord</span>. When cryonicists see us cheer on a billionaire who fights cancer and shake our heads at one who signs up for cryonics, when they see us praying for someone in a coma and rolling our eyes at someone being vitrified—they see us being highly irrational.</p>
<p><strong>2) </strong>Cryonicists view death not as an all-powerful overlord but as a puzzle to be solved. They see humans as an arrangement of atoms and see no reason that arrangement should have to inevitably deteriorate if our scientists can just get better at working with atoms. So for them, trying to defeat death altogether is an obvious, rational mission to undertake. But most of us view death as a fundamental fact of the universe—a mysterious and terrifying shadow that hovers over all living things and that only a naive fool would try to escape from—so instead of cheering on the people trying to solve the puzzle of death, we scoff at them and laugh at them, as if they&#8217;re too immature to come to peace with the inevitable.</p>
<p>Looking at this through a zoomed out lens was a big <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html" target="_blank">Whoa Moment</a> epiphany for me. Suddenly, I saw the cryonicists&#8217; of the world in the same light as those rare ancient people trying to understand how earthquakes work so they could be best prepared for the next one, and I realized that when I shook my head at Peter Thiel, I was being like one of the hordes of ancient people who worshipped the gods that had punished us with that earthquake and who wanted to burn those rare scientists at the stake for their blasphemous thinking.</p>
<p>I started this post thinking I&#8217;d simply write a &#8220;mini post&#8221; about this little community of cryonicists and what they were trying to do and ended it staring at another example of today&#8217;s self-proclaimed science-minded rationalists being tomorrow&#8217;s idol-worshippers.</p>
<p>I also saw my conception of end-of-life morality flip itself on its head. At the beginning of my research, my question was, &#8220;Is cryonics an okay thing to do?&#8221; By the end, the question was , &#8220;Is it okay to <em>not</em> sign up a dying child for cryonics, or will future people view that the way we see a parent refusing to allow life-saving medical treatment to their child for religious reasons?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cryonics has quickly come to seem not only like a good thing to try, but like <em>the right thing to do</em>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s certainly how Alcor sees it. They say:</p>
<p><em>The moral argument for cryonics is that it&#8217;s wrong to discontinue care of an unconscious person when they can still be rescued. This is why people who fall unconscious are taken to hospital by ambulance, why they will be maintained for weeks in intensive care if necessary, and why they will still be cared for even if they don&#8217;t fully awaken after that. It is a moral imperative to care for unconscious people as long as there remains reasonable hope for recovery.</em></p>
<p>And once you&#8217;re looking through that lens, everything we consider normal starts to look crazy.</p>
<p>When <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/us/cancer-immortality-cryogenics.html?_r=0" target="_blank">Kim Suozzi</a> found out she was dying of cancer at age 23, she signed up to be cryopreserved. She viewed it like trying a new experimental drug that might have a chance to save her when nothing else could—a no-brainer. But her father fiercely resisted the decision,<a href="#footnote-11-4836" id="note-11-4836" rel="footnote">11</a> Reddit users scorned her for it, and the story was unusual enough to warrant a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/us/cancer-immortality-cryogenics.html" target="_blank">feature article</a> in the New York Times.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s as if Kim was part of a group of the world&#8217;s cancer-stricken 23-year-olds as they all walked toward a cliff to fall into the jaws of the overlord, and Kim saw a rope hanging from a higher cliff across the chasm and decided to jump for it because maybe, just maybe, it could pull her to safety. And the <em>Times</em> found that to be so bizarre, and so out there, that they wrote a piece on it. Huh?</p>
<p>From far away, it looks a lot like we&#8217;re all on a plane that&#8217;s going down, with our only shot at survival being to take a chance with an experimental parachute—and we&#8217;re all just staying in our seats.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve decided to take a parachute and jump. I have an appointment set up for early April with a life insurance agent and Alcor member to get set up with a plan. I can boil the decision down to three reasons:</p>
<p><strong>1) I love life. </strong>Readers have picked up on my mild obsession with death, which might have something to do with the 55 times I&#8217;ve talked about it on this blog. But when they bring it up with me, they refer to it as my fear of death. Which isn&#8217;t quite how I feel. It&#8217;s more that I really like life. I like doing things and thinking things and I like my family and friends and want to keep hanging out with them if I can. I also really want to see what happens. I want to be there when we figure out the <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html" target="_blank">Fermi Paradox</a> and when we discover what dark matter is and when we terraform Mars and when AI takes all our jobs and then extincts all of us. I want to see what the 23rd century is like and see how cool the phones are by then. Being alive is a lot more interesting than being dead. And since I have all of eternity to be dead, it seems logical to stay not dead for at least a while when I have the chance.</p>
<p><strong>2) This chart. </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Table.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-5065"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5065" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Table.png" alt="Table" width="400" height="391" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Table.png 862w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Table-300x293.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Table-768x750.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Table-600x586.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>3) Hope. </strong>I&#8217;ve always been jealous of religious people, because on their deathbed, instead of thinking, &#8220;Shit,&#8221; they&#8217;re thinking, &#8220;Okay here&#8217;s the big moment—am I about to blink and wake up in heaven??&#8221; Much more fun. And much more exciting. Whether cryonics pans out or not, as I age, at least a little part of me can now be thinking, &#8220;I wonder what&#8217;s gonna happen when I die?&#8221; Atheists aren&#8217;t supposed to get to think that. Humans don&#8217;t need a huge amount of hope to feel hopeful—they just need something to cling onto. Just enough to be able to have the &#8220;So you&#8217;re sayin there&#8217;s a chance!&#8221; feeling.</p>
<p>Some of you will resonate with my decision—others will think it makes me silly, gullible, or selfish.</p>
<p>Either way, you should think about this and the fact that you currently have a plan, whether you realize it or not. Likely, that plan is to resign to death. To walk off the cliff instead of jumping for the lifeline. To stay planted in your seat as the plane goes down.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not necessarily the wrong decision, depending on who you are, what you believe, and what you value. But if that&#8217;s your plan, it should be because you like that plan more than the alternative—not because you haven&#8217;t thought about it and are just doing what everyone else is doing. This is a matter of your one existence, and you have to take the fate of that existence into your own, independent-thinking hands.</p>
<p>And if you decide that you probably would rather grab a parachute than stay in your seat, try not to fall victim to a common trap:</p>
<p>Cryocrastination.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a real term used in the cryonics world to describe the phenomenon of people—especially young people—saying, &#8220;Yeah duh I&#8217;m obviously doing cryonics when I die&#8221; and then not actually going through the actions to sign up and start paying money. It&#8217;s natural—what could possibly be easier to procrastinate on? That item on your list—&#8221;sign up for cryonics&#8221;—tends to never find itself at the <em>top </em>of the to-do list. But no matter what age you are, unexpected things can happen, and if you never got around to signing up when they do, you&#8217;re out of luck. If you take a big step back, procrastinating on this is <em>really </em>shortsighted. Just do what I did—book appointments so you&#8217;ll actually do it.</p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;ll do it the same way I&#8217;d hope you&#8217;d take a shot with an experimental drug if you were sick and it were the one chance you had. Because it&#8217;s worth a try. Because it just might work. Because why the fuck not. And because Dylan Thomas said it best:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Do not go gentle into that good night.<br />
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</em></p>

<p>The other thing from this post that was inspired from outside work is the concept of death as an overlord, which is loosely based on the storyline of Nick Bostrom&#8217;s <em><a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html" target="_blank">The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant</a></em>, where the role of death is played by a dragon. If you liked that part of the post, definitely read the fable.</p>

These brain banks would not exist if biomolecules could not be preserved by freezing, even hours after clinical death.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is part of Mini Week, where I&#8217;m posting a new mini post but not actually mini as it turns out every weekday this week.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been a little confused about sound. So for &#8220;Tuesday&#8217;s&#8221; &#8220;mini&#8221; post, I decided to do something about that.</p>
<p>We think of sound as something we <em>hear</em>—something that makes <em>noise</em>. But in pure physics terms, sound is just a vibration going through matter.</p>
<p>The way a vibration &#8220;goes through&#8221; matter is in the form of a sound wave. When you think of sound waves, you probably think of something like this:<a href="#footnote2-1-4885" id="note2-1-4885" rel="footnote2">1</a>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ezgif.com-optimize.gif" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-4886"><img class="size-full wp-image-4886 aligncenter" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ezgif.com-optimize.gif" alt="ezgif.com-optimize" width="531" height="283" /></a></p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not how sound waves work. A wave like that is called a transverse wave, where each individual particle moves up and down to create a snake situation.</p>
<p>A sound wave is more like an earthworm situation:<a href="#footnote2-2-4885" id="note2-2-4885" rel="footnote2">2</a>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/earthworm.gif" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-4887"><img class="size-full wp-image-4887 aligncenter" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/earthworm.gif" alt="earthworm" width="480" height="270" /></a></p>
<p>Like an earthworm, sound moves by compressing and decompressing. This is called a longitudinal wave. A slinky can do both kinds of waves:<a href="#footnote-1-4885" id="note-1-4885" rel="footnote">1</a><a href="#footnote2-3-4885" id="note2-3-4885" rel="footnote2">3</a>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/slinky.gif" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-4888"><img class="size-full wp-image-4888 aligncenter" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/slinky.gif" alt="slinky" width="320" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>Sound starts with a vibration of some kind creating a longitudinal wave through matter. Check this out:<a href="#footnote2-4-4885" id="note2-4-4885" rel="footnote2">4</a>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/red-dot.gif" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-4889"><img class="wp-image-4889 aligncenter" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/red-dot.gif" alt="red dot" width="712" height="237" /></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s what sound looks like—except picture an expanding ripple of <em>spheres</em> doing that. In this animation, the sound wave is being generated by that vibrating grey bar on the left. The bar might be your vocal chords, a guitar string, or a waterfall continually pounding down into the river below. By looking at the red dots, you can see that even though the wave moves in one direction, each individual particle only moves back and forth, mimicking the vibration of the gray bar.</p>
<p>So instead of a curvy snake wave, sound is a <em>pressure </em>wave, which causes each piece of the air to be at either higher-than-normal pressure or lower-than-normal pressure. So when you see a snake-like illustration of a sound wave, it&#8217;s referring to the measure of pressure, <em>not </em>the literal path of movement of the particles:<a href="#footnote2-5-4885" id="note2-5-4885" rel="footnote2">5</a>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Wave.gif" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-4890"><img class="size-full wp-image-4890 aligncenter" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Wave.gif" alt="Wave" width="490" height="360" /></a></p>
<p>Sound waves can go through air, which is how we normally experience it. But it can also go through liquid<a href="#footnote-2-4885" id="note-2-4885" rel="footnote">2</a> or solid matter—much of the jolting that happens during an earthquake is the result of a huge sound wave whizzing through the earth (in that case, the movement of the fault is serving as the gray and red bars in the animations above).</p>
<p>How about the speed of sound? Well it depends on how quickly the pressure wave can move in a given medium. A medium that&#8217;s more fluid, like air, is highly compressible, so it takes longer for the wave to move, while water is far less compressible, so there&#8217;s less &#8220;give&#8221; to slow the wave down. It&#8217;s like two people holding an outstretched slinky between them—if one pushes their end toward the other person, the wave will take a little time to travel down the slinky before the other person feels it. But if the two people are holding a broomstick, when one pushes, the other feels it immediately, because the broomstick is much less compressible.<a href="#footnote2-6-4885" id="note2-6-4885" rel="footnote2">6</a>
<p>So it makes sense that the speed of sound in air (768 mph / 1,234 kmph under normal conditions) is about four times slower than the speed of sound in water, which itself is about four times slower than the speed of sound through a solid like iron.</p>
<p>Back to us and <em>hearing</em>. Ears are an evolutionary innovation that allows us to register sound waves in the air around us and process them as information—without ears, most sound waves would be imperceptible to a human with only the loudest sounds registering as a felt vibration on our skin. Ears give us a magical ability to sense even slight sound waves in a way so nuanced, it can usually tell us exactly where the sound is coming from and what the meaning of it is. And it enables us to talk. The most important kind of human communication happens when our brains send information to other brains through complex patterns of <em>air pressure waves</em>. Have you ever stopped and thought about how incredible that is?</p>
<p>I was about to move on, but sorry, I can&#8217;t get over this. The next time you&#8217;re talking to someone, I want you to stop and think about what&#8217;s happening. Your brain has a thought. It translates that thought into a pattern of pressure waves. Then your lungs send air out of your body, but as you do that, you vibrate your vocal chords in <em>just </em>the right way and you move your mouth and tongue into <em>just </em>the right shapes that by the time the air leaves you, it&#8217;s embedded with a pattern of high and low pressure areas. The code in that air then spreads out to all the air in the vicinity, a little bit of which ends up in your friend&#8217;s ear, where it passes by their eardrum. When it does, it vibrates their eardrum in such a way as to pass on not only the code, but exactly where in the room it came from and the particular tone of voice it came with. The eardrum&#8217;s vibrations are transmitted through three tiny bones and into a little sac of fluid, which then transmits the information into electrical impulses and sends them up the auditory nerve and into the brain, where the information is decoded. And all of that happens in an eighth of a second, without any effort from either of you. Talking is a <em>miracle</em>.</p>
<p>Anyway—</p>
<p>The ear can discern many qualities of a sound it hears, but two of the most fundamental are pitch and loudness.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Pitch</strong></span></p>
<p>Pitch is all about wavelength—i.e. how far apart the pressure waves are:<a href="#footnote2-7-4885" id="note2-7-4885" rel="footnote2">7</a>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Wave-2.gif" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-4892"><img class=" wp-image-4892 aligncenter" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Wave-2.gif" alt="Wave 2" width="506" height="372" /></a></p>
<p>The shorter the wavelength, the higher the pitch. Humans can hear frequencies as low as 20 Hz (which is a 56 ft /17 m long wave) and as high as 20,000 Hz (.7 in / 1.7 cm). As you age, you lose your ability to hear the highest pitches, so most of you probably hear nothing when you <a href="http://plasticity.szynalski.com/tone-generator.htm" target="_blank">listen to the frequencies</a> approaching 20,000 Hz (your dog will disagree). But you&#8217;ll have an easier time hearing the lowest part of the range.<a href="#footnote2-8-4885" id="note2-8-4885" rel="footnote2">8</a> The reason you can <em>feel </em>low sounds, like low bass notes in music, is that the wavelength is so long that it actually takes 1/20th of a second for a full wave to pass your body (hence 20 Hz).<a href="#footnote-3-4885" id="note-3-4885" rel="footnote">3</a><a href="#footnote-4-4885" id="note-4-4885" rel="footnote">4</a>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Loudness</strong></span></p>
<p>The loudness<a href="#footnote-5-4885" id="note-5-4885" rel="footnote">5</a> of a sound we hear is determined by the <em>amplitude</em> of the pressure waves. In the animation above, the high and low-pitched sounds depicted have the same loudness, because the pressure curves at the bottom of the animation are the same size <em>vertically</em>. Louder sounds have a larger oscillation between the low and high pressure sections of the wave—i.e. loud sounds have higher high-pressure and lower low-pressure parts than quiet sounds.</p>
<p>For sounds through the air on Earth&#8217;s surface, the average of the high-pressure and low-pressure parts of the wave is our normal atmospheric pressure—what we call 1 &#8220;atmosphere&#8221; of pressure. So a sound wave might have a high pressure component of 1.0001 atmospheres and a low pressure component of .9999 atmospheres, and a louder sound might be 1.01/.99 instead—but in both cases, the average of the two is 1 atmosphere.</p>
<p>We often measure loudness using a unit called the decibel (named after Alexander Graham Bell). If you want to be confused, read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel" target="_blank">Wikipedia page on decibels</a>. It&#8217;s a super icky unit. And rather than bore us both by explaining it, let&#8217;s just talk about how we use decibels to measure sound.</p>
<p>The scale of loudness has a very tiny minimum. The faintest sounds are far softer than any human could hear—even softer than any of our finest scientific instruments could detect. But depending on where you are, sound has a hard maximum. The reason is that sound isn&#8217;t a thing in itself—it&#8217;s a pressure wave moving through a medium. And since, as we talked about, the average of the high and low pressure points of a sound wave has to be the normal pressure of the medium, loudness is limited by the fact that eventually, the low pressure point hits zero-pressure—a vacuum. Since the low pressure can&#8217;t go any lower, that&#8217;s the max amplitude of a sound wave on the Earth&#8217;s surface and the loudest a sound can be here.</p>
<p>The convenient thing about decibels (dB) is that the absolute faintest sound detectable to the human ear is, by definition, 0 dB—we call that &#8220;the threshold of hearing.&#8221; Scientists do their best to study sounds <a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2012/jul-aug/06-shh-scientists-listening-smallest-possible-noise" target="_blank">far down into the negative decibel scale</a> and there are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXVGIb3bzHI" target="_blank">man-made rooms</a> on Earth that register as low as -9.4 dB—where it&#8217;s so quiet you can hear the blood pumping through your own brain—but we can only hear sounds in the dB positives. The loudest a sustained sound can possibly be on Earth&#8217;s surface is 194 dB—which is when the amplitude of the sound wave is so intense that the low pressure part is a perfect vacuum (the wave alternates between double the normal atmospheric pressure and no air at all—not something you want to be present for). Let&#8217;s take a look at the full scale, starting with the really quiet.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that with decibels, each increase of 10 dB <em>doubles </em>the loudness. So 20 dB is twice as loud as 10 dB, 30 dB is four times as loud as 10 dB, and 80 dB is 128 times louder than 10 dB.<a href="#footnote-6-4885" id="note-6-4885" rel="footnote">6</a><a href="#footnote2-9-4885" id="note2-9-4885" rel="footnote2">9</a>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Decibels-Chart-4.png" rel="attachment wp-att-5079"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5079" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Decibels-Chart-4.png" alt="Decibels Chart" width="800" height="2560" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Decibels-Chart-4.png 1000w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Decibels-Chart-4-94x300.png 94w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Decibels-Chart-4-768x2458.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>The scale stops at 194 because there&#8217;s no such thing as a louder sound on Earth&#8217;s surface. But we can go beyond here in two ways:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>1) Shock Waves</strong></span></p>
<p>When enough energy is released to pass the 194 dB mark, it&#8217;s too much to create a sustained pressure <em>wave </em>because we&#8217;ve bottomed out on low pressure—but things still <em>happen</em>. Very, very intense things.</p>
<p>At 194 dB, there&#8217;s a maxed out wave alternating between double the normal pressure and a total vacuum—but once we get to 195 dB, the energy stops moving <em>through </em>the air and starts <em>pushing </em>the air outward with an expanding vacuum. The more dBs above 194 there are, the farther reaching and higher-impact that vacuum bubble will be. It expands outward as a rapidly-growing half-sphere:<a href="#footnote2-10-4885" id="note2-10-4885" rel="footnote2">10</a>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/bomb-1.gif" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-4897"><img class="size-full wp-image-4897 aligncenter" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/bomb-1.gif" alt="bomb 1" width="420" height="236" /></a></p>
<p>On the edge of the bubble is a barrier of super-compressed gas, and when this barrier sweeps over the land, it usually flattens whatever&#8217;s in its path:<a href="#footnote2-11-4885" id="note2-11-4885" rel="footnote2">11</a>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/bomb-2.gif" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-4896"><img class="size-full wp-image-4896 aligncenter" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/bomb-2.gif" alt="bomb 2" width="480" height="278" /></a></p>
<p>As the hemisphere expands, it loses energy and eventually dissipates. But if you found yourself in the path of a shock wave before that happened, you&#8217;d have a bad time. First, the impact of the super-compressed barrier would be like hitting a brick wall (in the same way and for the same reason falling on water from a bridge is like falling on concrete). Second, compressed air is <em>hot</em>. Third, it wouldn&#8217;t just hit all parts of your body, it would go <em>through </em>your body, and if it were powerful enough it could turn your bones to powder and your organs to soup.</p>
<p>Here are some famous 194dB+ events:</p>
<p><strong>Saturn V launch: </strong>The Saturn V was a beast, and the sound waves from its launches were so intense that they could light grass on fire a mile away. Even at three miles away, an observer would experience ear-splitting 135 dB sound.<a href="#footnote2-12-4885" id="note2-12-4885" rel="footnote2">12</a> Rocket launches create such a powerful sound, that space agencies <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/missions/shuttle/f_watertest.html" target="_blank">flood the launchpad</a> with water as the rocket launches to absorb the sound so the force of the pressure wave doesn&#8217;t damage the rocket.</p>
<p><strong>The Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs: </strong>According to sources I read, these clocked in at well over 200 dB. The shock wave was so charged that it traveled 7 mi / 11 km in 30 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>The 1883 Krakatoa volcano eruption:</strong><a href="#footnote2-13-4885" id="note2-13-4885" rel="footnote2">13</a><strong> </strong>I&#8217;m overwhelmed by the amount of things I need to tell you about the Krakatoa. Let&#8217;s do bullets.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/qCPmXK7gJR12" target="_blank">Krakatoa</a> is an island in Indonesia, and the eruption happened on August 27, 1883.</li>
<li>The eruption completely annihilated the island, sent an enormous amount of debris 17 miles (27 km) high into the sky at half a mile per second. It also caused one of the most deadly and far-reaching tsunamis in history. In total, the eruption killed 36,000 people.</li>
<li>But the most amazing thing about the eruption was its sound. It made arguably the loudest sound on Earth in modern history.</li>
<li>It was so loud that the shock wave extended far enough to rupture the eardrums of sailors 40 miles away.</li>
<li>100 miles away, the sound was still 172 dB, enough to permanently destroy someone&#8217;s ears or even kill them. Wherever you are, think of a place that&#8217;s about 100 miles (161 km) away. Now imagine something happening there that causes a sound so loud where <em>you </em>are that if you were screaming at the top of your lungs directly into someone&#8217;s ear when the sound hit, they wouldn&#8217;t be able to hear that you were doing it. For comparison, the Saturn V launch sound was at 170 dB 100 <em>meters </em>away. Krakatoa was higher than that 100 <em>miles </em>away.</li>
<li>The sound cracked a foot-thick concrete wall 300 miles (483 km) away.</li>
<li>The sound was heard all the way in Australia (where it sounded like a distant canon ball being fired) and even as far away as Rodrigues Island, 3,000 miles away. <em>3,000 miles away</em>. I&#8217;m currently in New York. <em>Imagine if something happened in California or in Europe that I could hear</em><em> in New York. </em>I can&#8217;t even.</li>
<li>After the sound eventually got far enough away that humans couldn&#8217;t hear it anymore, barometers all over the world were going nuts for the next few days, as the sound waves circled the Earth <em>3.5 times</em>.</li>
<li>Finally, you know the famous painting <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/The_Scream.jpg" target="_blank">The Scream</a>? Well you know how the sky&#8217;s all red for some reason? The sky is red because the painter, Edvard Munch, was inspired to paint it after seeing the Krakatoa-caused red skies all over the Western Hemisphere in the year after the eruption.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a big eruption.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>2) Other Mediums</strong></span></p>
<p>There <em>can</em> be louder sound<em> </em>than 194 dB—just not on the Earth&#8217;s surface. There can be louder sounds in the ocean, in the land, or on other planets. The gas giants in our Solar System, for example, have denser atmospheres than Earth&#8217;s, which allow for higher pressure wave amplitudes, and with incredibly fast winds and powerful storms, there&#8217;s plenty of opportunity there to make loud things.</p>
<p>What <em>isn&#8217;t </em>loud is almost everything else in space. You&#8217;ve probably heard the term, &#8220;Sound doesn&#8217;t travel in a vacuum,&#8221; but it makes sense now, right? Sound is pressure waves through matter. If there&#8217;s no matter, there&#8217;s no sound. There can be immense <em>heat</em>, and <em>radiation</em>, and <em>force</em>, but to a nearby observing human, it&#8217;s all dead silent.</p>
<p>If, hypothetically, there <em>were </em>air filling the universe, then suddenly things would get <em>very </em>loud. Forget the terrifying concept of the sound of a supernova—just the dumb sun sitting there hanging out would ring in at an astounding 290 dB. According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/33xuxu/if_sound_could_travel_through_space_how_loud/" target="_blank">one solar physicist</a>, we&#8217;d hear that on <em>Earth </em>as a 100 dB sound—<em>the volume of a motorcycle</em>—all the time, every day, everywhere. Be happy that sound doesn&#8217;t travel in a vacuum.</p>
<p>One last thought—</p>
<p>Researching for this post and learning about what sound is gave me a new perspective on the tree falling in the forest with nobody there to hear it question. I now think that no, it doesn&#8217;t make a sound. It makes an air pressure wave and that&#8217;s it. The concept of sound is by definition a biological being&#8217;s perception of the pressure wave—and if there are no ears around to perceive the pressure wave, there&#8217;s no sound. It&#8217;s a little like asking, &#8220;If humans go extinct, and somewhere in the post-apocalyptic rubble, there&#8217;s a photo of a beautiful woman lying there—is she still beautiful?&#8221; I kind of don&#8217;t think she is. Because the only thing that&#8217;s beautiful about her is that humans found her beautiful, and without humans, she&#8217;s no more beautiful than the female beetle a few feet away, rummaging around the rubble. Right?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard this Seinfeld joke:</p>
<p><em>According to most studies, people&#8217;s number one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. Death is number two. Does that sound right? This means to the average person, if you go to a funeral, you&#8217;re better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.</em></p>
<p>Knowing humans, this shouldn&#8217;t be that surprising. I&#8217;ve mentioned <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html" target="_blank">before</a> that we all have this problem where we&#8217;re weirdly obsessed with what other people think of us, so it makes sense that public speaking should be our collective phobia.</p>
<p>But then we also live in a world where public speaking can happen to any of us at any time. Even if you never give an official &#8220;talk,&#8221; there&#8217;ll be some other time when you have to give a big toast at a wedding or present in front of a big group at work or speak at a funeral or some other ceremony. Very few of us are safe.</p>
<p>Over the last couple years, as I&#8217;ve done a small amount of Wait But Why-related public speaking, I&#8217;ve been able to slowly get over the fear. I&#8217;ve learned that if you just be yourself and talk like you normally do, it&#8217;s usually received well by the audience, even if you&#8217;re clearly nervous.</p>
<p>And that was all fine until August of 2015, when I was invited to do a TED Talk.</p>
<p>The issue is, a TED Talk is not a speaking gig. In a speaking gig, I stand in front of a group of people and say stuff. That&#8217;s not what a TED Talk is. A TED Talk is a widely-distributed short film, except the only actor is my face and the only plot is me saying words out of my face and the only choreographer is my nervous pacing and awkward arm-flailing, and instead of a bunch of cuts and different shots and a long editing process, there&#8217;s just one do-or-die take, with no second chances.</p>
<p>No, what? No. Obviously not. Who would <em>ever </em>agree to do something like that.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the problem: Who turns down TED? Not really an option, right? Let&#8217;s pause to go through some background:</p>
<p>TED actually started way back in 1984, founded by <a href="https://www.nantucketproject.com/idea-films/rsw" target="_blank">Richard Saul Wurman</a>, as a small, Silicon Valley annual gathering. The name is an acronym for Wurman&#8217;s intention for the focus of the conference: Technology, Entertainment, Design. Through the 1990s, the conference grew both in attendance and in the scope of its topics.</p>
<p>In 2002, media entrepreneur Chris Anderson bought TED from Wurman (through a non-profit he owns) and has run it ever since. He broadened TED&#8217;s content focus to &#8220;ideas worth spreading,&#8221; and in 2006, TED began doing something that would launch the brand into the stratosphere—they put the talks online.</p>
<p>I first heard of TED in 2008, when someone sent me Jill Bolte Taylor&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jill_bolte_taylor_s_powerful_stroke_of_insight?language=en" target="_blank">amazing talk</a> about what she learned from the experience of having a stroke. You probably first heard of TED around the same time. And a few years later, almost everyone knew what a TED Talk was. Anderson describes TED&#8217;s rise to global prominence like this:</p>
<p><em>It used to be 800 people getting together once a year; now it’s about a million people a day watching TED Talks online. When we first put up a few of the talks as an experiment, we got such impassioned responses that we decided to flip the organization on its head and think of ourselves not so much as a conference but as &#8220;ideas worth spreading,&#8221; building a big website around it. The conference is still the engine, but the website is the amplifier that takes the ideas to the world.</em><a href="#footnote2-1-4737" id="note2-1-4737" rel="footnote2">1</a>
<p>The TED brand has expanded in a lot of ways, but maybe most notably through TEDx conferences. This can be a little confusing, so here&#8217;s the deal: There&#8217;s still one annual TED conference, a week-long event in Vancouver, and it&#8217;s run by the TED staff. A TEDx conference is independently run, but it has to follow a set of guidelines laid out by TED so that it fits with the overall brand. There are now over 1,500 annual TEDx events that happen in over 130 countries, some of them major, high-profile conferences;<a href="#footnote-1-4737" id="note-1-4737" rel="footnote">1</a> others tiny and little-known. The best TEDx talks are posted on TED.com, alongside the talks that happen at the main conference in Vancouver.</p>
<p>The thing I was asked to speak at was the big Vancouver one. I say this not only to brag, but also to explain why this whole thing had me freaking out so much. The same thing that made it extra extra scary also made it extra extra not turn-downable.</p>
<p>So I accepted.</p>
<p>As I thought through what I had just committed myself to, I identified a number of concerns, like me not having a topic, or the fact that TED Talks are short and narrow and I tend to be the opposite. But perhaps most worrying was the prospect of this being an Exact Script situation. Let me explain (if you&#8217;d rather just read the rest of my TED story, skip down to the comic)—</p>
<p>When you speak in public, you have three main options about how to go about it, and they fall along a spectrum:</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-1-3.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-4749"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4749" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-1-3.png" alt="Prep Spectrum 1" width="653" height="207" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-1-3.png 1574w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-1-3-300x95.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-1-3-768x244.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-1-3-600x191.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 653px) 100vw, 653px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>1) Wing it</strong></span></p>
<p>At the cockiest end of the spectrum, you have the option of completely winging it. This involves no planning—you just get up there and figure out what you want to say once you&#8217;re talking. You be yourself and let the moment carry you.</p>
<p>This takes some hardcore self-confidence, and it only works if you&#8217;re <em>really </em>good, and if you&#8217;re in the right mood and in front of the right crowd. It&#8217;s a really great way to do a really bad talk, and should probably be kept to super-casual things like impromptu dinner toasts.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>2) Talk through a set structure</strong></span></p>
<p>Here, you have a clear structure in your head or a list of bullet points on a notecard, and then you simply talk through it. But importantly, you haven&#8217;t scripted sentences exactly—if you did the talk five times, it would come out differently each time, but the general content would be the same. To do this, you have to be super comfortable with the content of what you want to say.</p>
<p>When you use this method, you come off like a human, because you&#8217;re actually coming up with real sentences as you go, which is how a normal person talks. Your brain is focused on the content of what you&#8217;re saying, and your words are emerging directly from your current thoughts.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t an exact point on the spectrum but a range. On the left side of the range, closer to the winging it end, you have a few general bullets or slides, but you&#8217;ve planned almost nothing beyond that. Toward the right side, you&#8217;ve planned out almost exactly what you want to say, including the placement and wording of certain jokes or other key sentences, but it still comes out a little differently each time you do it.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>3) Follow an exact script</strong></span></p>
<p>Here, on the other extreme end of the spectrum, you write the exact script of the talk ahead of time and deliver the talk on script, word for word. Some people might immediately assume this method will make a talk impersonal and robotic, but it&#8217;s more complicated than that—the exact script method has its own spectrum:</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-2.png" rel="attachment wp-att-4747"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4747" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-2.png" alt="Prep Spectrum 2" width="700" height="262" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-2.png 2028w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-2-300x112.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-2-768x288.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-2-600x225.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>3A) Read off a script</strong></span></p>
<p>This is simple: You write a script, and the talk is you reading it out loud. During the talk, you&#8217;re just acting as the messenger—you&#8217;re a functional medium connecting the thoughts of your past self to the present audience.</p>
<p>This is the safest and least stressful way to give a talk and it usually puts the audience to sleep, regardless of how good the content is. Audiences have a fine-tuned radar for when they&#8217;re listening to a person say something versus when they&#8217;re listening to a person <em>recite</em> something—in the latter case, the speaker isn&#8217;t really <em>there </em>in the room with the audience, which has a way of making everyone <em>really</em> want to start playing with their phone.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>3B) <strong>Just barely memorized</strong></strong></span></p>
<p>As you move along the scripted spectrum from 3A to 3B, you go from entirely reading, to reading mostly but with some looks up at the audience, to mostly looking up at the audience with some glances down to the paper, to totally memorized with no paper in hand.</p>
<p>A paperless 3B speaker won&#8217;t come off much different than a 3A speaker. The 3B speaker isn&#8217;t technically reading off of a script, but he might as well be. Because his memorization of the script is fragile, his mind isn&#8217;t focused on the content of what he&#8217;s saying—it&#8217;s focused on reciting the words he memorized. He&#8217;ll struggle to make eye contact, and his sentences will come off just robotic enough to make the audience clear that he&#8217;s a mostly-unthinking messenger of a written script. Phones will be reached for.</p>
<p>The main difference is that while 3A is the safest method of all, 3B is the riskiest. Going for it without the paper when you only barely have the talk memorized is a great way to disastrously go blank mid-talk.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>3C) Happy-Birthday-level memorized</strong></span></p>
<p>When you get to 3C, you don&#8217;t just have the script memorized, you have it memorized <em>cold</em>. And that&#8217;s a <em>key </em>distinction. If you&#8217;re in a restaurant and your table starts singing Happy Birthday to someone you&#8217;re with, you can join in with them even if you&#8217;re simultaneously taking a picture of the birthday girl, moving some stuff out of the way so the waiter has a place on the table to put the cake, observing the other people in the restaurant looking over and wishing this wasn&#8217;t happening, and four other things. It&#8217;s no problem—you can still sing the lyrics. You can do that because the lyrics to Happy Birthday aren&#8217;t coming out of your conscious mind—they&#8217;re coming out of your subconscious. They&#8217;re coming out automatically, and your conscious mind can focus entirely on other things while you&#8217;re singing.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how well-memorized 3C is.</p>
<p>The people at TED refer to two tests you need to pass to qualify as Happy-Birthday-level memorized:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you record yourself saying the talk and play it back at 2x speed, can you say it out loud while it&#8217;s playing and stay <em>ahead </em>of the recording?</li>
<li>Can you recite the talk with no problem while simultaneously doing an unrelated task that requires attention, like following a recipe and measuring out the ingredients into a bowl?</li>
</ol>
<p>Memorizing something to this degree might seem like a daunting task, but everyone who&#8217;s ever acted in a play has done it. It&#8217;s not as impossible as it sounds, because the human brain is able to engrave things to that level if you just rehearse enough and sleep on it enough times.</p>
<p>When a speaker has memorized their talk to this extent, they <em>can </em>be in the room with the audience, even though they&#8217;re reciting a previously-written script, because their conscious mind is freed up to <em>think</em> about what they&#8217;re saying instead of tied up with the task of remembering which line comes next. This allows the speaker to make eye contact and to bring their live personality into the picture to reflect the words being said in real time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d sum up the pros and cons of the five options like this:</p>

<p>On this chart, all three items in the key are bad. Those are the three things that can suck about public speaking. So high-up dots are bad. Looking at this chart, here are some conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If and only if the talk is super low-stakes—like an impromptu toast at a group dinner—winging it is a good option. It&#8217;s the only method that takes no prep, and it&#8217;s also the least robotic, which is perfect in casual situations where seeming like you prepped is awkward. But unless you&#8217;re very rad, winging a big talk is a bad idea.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Method 2 is the best overall choice much of the time, scoring well on all three criteria. It&#8217;s not that hard to prep for, you sound like a human, and it isn&#8217;t that stressful because with nothing to memorize, there&#8217;s nothing to forget, so if you know your material well and you&#8217;re feeling confident, things will go fine. The worst case scenario is that you lose your confidence during the talk and flounder through it. That&#8217;s a bad outcome, but it&#8217;s not a disaster. But Method 2 does require you to be calm and collected, so if you&#8217;re really scared of public speaking, it&#8217;s probably not the way to go. It also leaves you open to variability—depending on how the words come out, you might deliver a better or worse talk—so if the stakes are <em>super </em>high, it&#8217;s not a great option unless you&#8217;re a seasoned pro.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Method 3A—reading off a script—is a pretty bad option, with one huge plus: It&#8217;s the least scary by far. For people who are <em>terrified </em>of public speaking, they may just want to cling to Method 3A&#8217;s leg and call it a day. But the safety comes at a high cost, in that you&#8217;re leaving yourself with almost no chance of delivering a great talk and a high chance of having the audience tune out. It should be noted that in certain high-gravitas situations, when it&#8217;s more of an official <em>speech </em>than a talk, the clearly-recited tone of a read speech can be appropriate, and even desired—like a graduation speech. In other cases, someone can be skilled enough at reading a script that they can do so in a human-seeming way. Obama is a good example—you often forget that he&#8217;s reading from a teleprompter most of the time you see him talk. But very few of us find ourselves involved with graduation speeches or teleprompters.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Method 3B—being memorized but just barely—is the worst of all worlds and should never happen. Never ever. If you&#8217;re at 3A and you decide to venture into memorization land and ditch the paper, you better be prepared to put in the time to get all the way to 3C, because here&#8217;s the deal: <img class="wp-image-4752 aligncenter" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph.png" alt="Memorization risk graph" width="615" height="328" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph.png 1870w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-300x160.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-768x410.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-600x320.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-374x200.png 374w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" />Even if you feel like you have things memorized when you&#8217;re alone in your house, once you&#8217;re in front of the audience, all of these new factors come into play. Your adrenaline is pumping and super-charging your muscles, your nerves take a shit, and a million new things enter your consciousness—the faces of the audience, the clock ticking down with your time limit, your self-awareness of how you&#8217;re standing and what you&#8217;re doing with your hands, your regret over messing up a sentence 30 seconds ago. And that well-memorized talk is suddenly not coming to you so easily. 3B is all of the robotic-ness of 3A with none of the safety. Avoid.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When the stakes are high and you want to deliver your best talk—but you&#8217;re not a seasoned pro who can pull off Method 2—you&#8217;re left with only one option: 3C. You have to write a great script and memorize it <em>cold</em>. 3C gives everyone an option of basically <em>ensuring</em> that you give a great talk, with relatively low risk. You only have to do one thing: spend eternity prepping. 3C takes <em>forever</em>. Writing a great script means working on it a ton and carefully honing every sentence, and memorizing it to Happy Birthday level takes a huge amount more time. You&#8217;re essentially writing a play, casting yourself, and then learning the part well enough to act it on a stage with no fear of forgetting your lines. Preparing to this level is a nightmare—but if the stakes are high enough, it&#8217;s worth the time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A quick note on wedding speeches. The best wedding speeches are usually Method 2 speeches, but most people are too scared to do that. But because they also don&#8217;t want to put <em>that </em>much effort into a wedding speech, most wedding speeches end up in 3A and 3B territory—which is why they&#8217;re usually pretty lame and boring and come along with a buzz of people quietly talking at the tables in the back. If you&#8217;re asked to give a wedding speech, don&#8217;t be a dick—it&#8217;s someone&#8217;s wedding. Either gather the guts to speak from the heart and go with Method 2, or put in the time it takes to get to 3C.</li>
</ul>
<p>Back to my situation. Over the past couple years, I had begun to find a groove doing not-that-high-stakes 30-to-60-minute talks using the off-the-cuff Method 2, but TED is both <em>far </em>higher stakes than normal and has a strict 14-minute time limit<a href="#footnote-2-4737" id="note-2-4737" rel="footnote">2</a>—meaning you need to be ultra concise and make every word count—so no way I was risking it with Method 2. I was scripting it and going to Happy Birthday land. I found that 90% of other TED speakers do the same thing.</p>
<p>This was gonna be a huge project.</p>
<p>Luckily for August Tim, none of this was his problem. He had an all-star team of employees to carry everything out.</p>

This wasn&#8217;t good. With only about a month to go till the talk and a scary rehearsal in front of the TED staff only days away, I was way behind. When it came time for the rehearsal, I had gotten a loose script together, but I wasn&#8217;t sure if I liked it.</p>
<p>The rehearsal took place in the TED office in New York, in front of a friendly but intimidating semi-circle of TED senior staff.</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rehearsal-1.png" rel="attachment wp-att-4762"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4762" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rehearsal-1.png" alt="Rehearsal 1" width="600" height="417" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rehearsal-1.png 1946w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rehearsal-1-300x209.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rehearsal-1-768x534.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rehearsal-1-600x417.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>I went through what I had, and it went okay until the last five minutes of the talk. I really didn&#8217;t like that part of the script, and during the rehearsal, I made the impromptu decision to go rogue and improvise, since I hated what was coming out of my mouth. This was a bad idea. What I ended up doing was a rambling and nonsensical ending that wasn&#8217;t that different from me picking words out of the dictionary at random and saying them.</p>

<p>There was a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>That night, the head of TED, Chris Anderson, hosted a dinner at his New York apartment for the speakers who were in town for rehearsals. If I already felt in over my head in this whole situation, meeting the other speakers didn&#8217;t help.</p>

<p>It was a rough start. But the dinner ended up making me feel better. It turns out that even rad people are terrified to do a TED Talk. And by the end, most people had admitted that they felt totally unqualified to be involved in this. Everyone else was going through the same thing I was.</p>
<p>January Tim felt better. So much better that he didn&#8217;t do that much for the rest of the month.</p>

<p>February Tim entered the world furious at every one of his co-workers. But he had no time to be angry—he had to work, every day, all day, immediately. And he did work, a lot, on the first 10 minutes of the talk—the part that was already in pretty good shape. That&#8217;s what procrastinators do.</p>
<p>On February 12th, four days before my talk, I flew to Vancouver, still not fully scripted. I got to my hotel and looked out the window, and there it was:</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/confrence.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-4814"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4814" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/confrence.jpg" alt="confrence" width="600" height="338" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/confrence.jpg 2208w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/confrence-300x169.jpg 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/confrence-768x432.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/confrence-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>All TED speakers do a fully mic&#8217;ed dress rehearsal on the real stage the weekend before the conference starts. Mine was three days before my talk—and it was pretty rough, confirming to me and everyone present that I was officially not a fraud when it came to my topic. The irony of a guy rehearsing his TED Talk about how he&#8217;s a bad procrastinator, and being clearly underprepared while doing so, was not lost on anyone.</p>
<p>At that point, the first 10 minutes of the talk was here:</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-4785"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4785" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-1.jpg" alt="Memorization risk graph 1" width="600" height="320" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-1.jpg 1870w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-1-300x160.jpg 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-1-768x410.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-1-600x320.jpg 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-1-374x200.jpg 374w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Not ideal, but with a lot of reps over the next three days, it was manageable. The bigger problem is that I still didn&#8217;t like the last third of the talk and kept rewriting it. So I&#8217;d practice a new ending for a while and get it here—</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-2.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-4786"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4786" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-2.jpg" alt="Memorization risk graph 2" width="600" height="354" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-2.jpg 1870w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-2-300x177.jpg 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-2-768x453.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-2-600x354.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>—only to then rewrite the last section, putting me back here with a whole new thing to memorize:</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-3.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-4787"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4787" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-3.jpg" alt="Memorization risk graph 3" width="600" height="316" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-3.jpg 1870w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-3-300x158.jpg 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-3-768x405.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-3-600x316.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>I fell into a routine of meeting up with fellow speaker and professor/author Adam Grant each night to show him my latest conclusion I hated. He was speaking the same day I was, right after me, but as the author of the book <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1Qrf1CA" target="_blank">Give and Take</a></em>, we both knew he had no choice but to be helpful anyway.</p>
<p>On Monday, the day before my talk, the conference began. There were whispers about who was in attendance for the week. Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford. Goldie Hawn and Cher. Tony Hsieh and Travis Kalanick and Chris Sacca and Steve Case and Al Gore. Even Jaden Smith.</p>
<p><em>Not helpful information.</em></p>
<p>I spent most of the day in my hotel room, alternating between rewriting the last part of the talk and trying to better memorize the first part. Finally, late that night, I settled on my final script. I liked it. Finally. Only one problem.</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-4.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-4788"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4788" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-4.jpg" alt="Memorization risk graph 4" width="600" height="385" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-4.jpg 1870w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-4-300x193.jpg 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-4-768x493.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-4-600x385.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Back at 3A with the last part <em>again, </em>this time with only about 16 hours until the talk.</p>
<p>I woke up the morning of my talk, did some jumping jacks in my hotel room like a psycho, and then spent four hours saying the last part over and over, eventually getting things here:</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-5.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-4789"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4789" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-5.jpg" alt="Memorization risk graph 5" width="600" height="318" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-5.jpg 1870w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-5-300x159.jpg 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-5-768x407.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-5-600x318.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>That would have to be good enough—I was out of time. I showed up at the theater the required 90 minutes before my talk for &#8220;hair and makeup,&#8221; i.e. an upsettingly-friendly lady painting my face with stuff while I engaged in a 10-minute discussion with her about her two cats back at home. Finally free of that, I spent the final hour pacing back and forth and running through the talk in my head, and then, suddenly, I was doing this:</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-3.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-4813"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4813" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-3.jpg" alt="FullSizeRender-3" width="800" height="600" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-3.jpg 992w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-3-300x225.jpg 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-3-768x576.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-3-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>I will say this: The TED stage is a weirdly comforting place. It doesn&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re in some huge theater—it feels like you&#8217;re on some little red circle surrounded by a bunch of friendly, supportive people who want you to succeed. They designed it that way on purpose, and it works. I was less nervous doing the actual talk than I had been in any of the rehearsals.</p>
<p>And as I made my way through the talk, disaster never struck. I made it through to the end without any major problems.</p>
<p><em>VICTORY.</em></p>
<p>When I was done, I sat in a seat they had reserved for me, blacked out, and watched the next series of talks. Immense relief.</p>
<p>The week then turned from what I had openly declared to be the worst week of my life into the best possible shit ever. I never knew much about the TED conference before, but it&#8217;s <em>very, very fun</em>. It&#8217;s like a little luxury playland where super fancy people come to relax and watch 70 <em>intensely </em>stressed-out, less fancy people get on stage, one by one, and say something interesting. And you know when you&#8217;re in a store and there&#8217;s some incredibly expensive package of high-end beef jerky or some $9 peanut butter cups by some weeping Brooklyn brand or some pixie bottle of juice that amounts to $6/sip and you don&#8217;t buy those things cause who has the nerve to actually live like that? Well all that shit is <em>everywhere </em>on these <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-6.jpg" target="_blank">racks</a> as you walk around TED, and it&#8217;s all <em>free</em>. I was chewing for 93% of my waking time the rest of the week.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d head into the theater in the morning, some ultra-organic, hyper-cleansing coconut chips in one hand, some wheatgrass extract thing in the other, a thermos full of coffee that took nine minutes for some guy to make using a bunch of test tubes resting in the pocket of the hoodie I wore all week because once your talk is done, literally nothing in the world matters anymore—and I&#8217;d plant myself in a seat in the theater and think, &#8220;I&#8217;m ready, speakers, for you to <em>entertain and educate me</em>. Let&#8217;s begin!&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only one stage and only one talk going on at a time, and that talk, in addition to happening live in the theater, is beamed through the entire conference center, which is full of screens and speakers. So sometimes, instead of watching talks in the theater, I&#8217;d watch in one of the many cozy simulcast viewing areas—maybe while lying on one of the hundreds of beanbags. Maybe while stretched out on grass under a tree.</p>

<p>Or maybe in a <em>plastic ball pit</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-5.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-4811"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4811" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-5.jpg" alt="FullSizeRender-5" width="550" height="733" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-5.jpg 3024w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-5-225x300.jpg 225w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-5-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-5-450x600.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a></p>
<p>Glorious.</p>
<p>Then it ended and I went home and everything costs money again and I have to do stuff again. Upsetting.</p>
<p>Anyway, that was my TED experience. To all those scared public speakers out there, I&#8217;d just say: the fear and dread of public speaking is almost always much worse than the actual experience of doing it. Everyone is just as uncomfortable with it as you are, and if you just put in a good amount of preparation, it almost always ends up going just fine. And then you&#8217;ll be really happy you went through all the hell leading up to it. So go for it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of us have a pretty terrible understanding of history. Our knowledge is spotty, with large gaps all over the place, and the parts of history we do end up knowing a lot about usually depend on the particular teachers, parents, books, articles, and movies we happen to come across in our lives. Without a foundational, tree-trunk understanding of all parts of history, we often forget the things we do learn, leaving even our favorite parts of history a bit hazy in our heads. Raise your hand if you&#8217;d like to go on stage and debate a history buff on the nuances of a historical time period of your choosing. That&#8217;s what I thought.</p>
<p>The reason history is so hard is that it&#8217;s so <em>soft</em>. To truly, fully understand a time period, an event, a movement, or an important historical figure, you&#8217;d have to be there, and many times over. You&#8217;d have to be in the homes of the public living at the time to hear what they&#8217;re saying; you&#8217;d have to be a fly on the wall in dozens of secret, closed-door meetings and conversations; you&#8217;d need to be inside the minds of the key players to know their innermost thoughts and motivations. Even then, you&#8217;d be lacking context. To really have the complete truth, you&#8217;d need background—the cultural nuances and national psyches of the time, the way each of the key players was raised during childhood and the subtle social dynamics between those players, the impact of what was going on in other parts of the world, and an equally-thorough understanding of the many past centuries that all of these things grew out of.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why not only can&#8217;t even the most perfect history buff fully understand history, but the key people involved <em>at the time</em> can&#8217;t ever know the full story. History is a giant collective tangle of thousands of interwoven stories involving millions of characters, countless chapters, and many, many narrators.</p>
<p>And you know humans—that&#8217;s not how they like things. The human brain really, really likes to <em>simplify </em>things. History provides the context of our world and our lives, because each of us is a character in this grand story—and the last thing we want to believe is that the story is too complicated and mysterious for us to understand.</p>
<p>Fairy tales are satisfying, because the plot is crystal clear—there are good guys and there are bad guys and there&#8217;s only one side of the story. Children identify with the good guys—the <em>us </em>guys—and they detest the bad guys—the <em>them</em> guys<em>—</em>and everyone&#8217;s happy. Stories written for adults aren&#8217;t that different—you loved <em>Shawshank </em>and <em>Braveheart</em> and <em>Star Wars</em>, right?</p>
<p>So when it comes to the story we&#8217;re all a <em>part </em>of, we most certainly want to feel the same way. We want history to be simple and clear, with good guys and bad guys, and we&#8217;d like to make sure that our ancestors, our ethnic group, our nation, and all the other tribes we belong to are Aladdin in the story—not Jafar.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that not everyone can be Aladdin. <em>Someone </em>has to be Jafar, right? Well, no. Not if there are many different story-tellers. Since no one is ever telling anything close to the full, real, <em>complete </em>story, in all its complexity—as we said, no one even <em>knows </em>the full story—each historian, each ruler, and each society creates their own fairy tale version of what went down in the past. When things are unsatisfyingly multi-faceted, we pick the facet we like best. When there are knowledge gaps, we make things up. When there are questions of motive, we pick one that fits nicely into the narrative.</p>
<p>This leaves us with plenty of tools to leave every story with a proper Aladdin and a proper Jafar and allows us to make sure that Aladdin is exactly who we want him to be.</p>
<p>The US is a good example. A huge number of people in today&#8217;s world have been told a story of the US in which the US is Aladdin, and a huge other number of people have heard the same story with the US as Jafar. Some people will claim to have a more nuanced view, but deep in their heart, when they see an American flag, they see either a good guy flag or a bad guy flag. (One of the major political divides in the US stems from liberals thinking conservatives over-Aladdinize the US and conservatives thinking liberals over-Jafarify the US while Aladdinizing the other side.)</p>
<p>This is the same phenomenon behind the stark opinion divide around Israel and Palestine. Hoards of people on both sides of what is an <em>insanely</em> complicated story are red in the face with ire at the other side, completely positive that their side is Aladdin and incensed that anyone could ever call the other side Aladdin and their side Jafar. Only with the stark clarity of a fairy tale could people ever feel so unshakingly sure.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s not that there are no good guys or bad guys in history. History is a pretty ugly story—what else would you expect from a species of primitive biological animals—and accountability for that ugliness isn&#8217;t spread out evenly amongst all people. To an extent, the definition of words like good and bad, right and wrong, and hero and villain lie in the eye of the beholder—but there&#8217;s also plenty of human behavior that qualifies as objectively good or bad.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s not that there are never objective Aladdins and there are never objective Jafars—it&#8217;s that almost none of us has any idea what the fuck we&#8217;re talking about. Point to a historical event and tell me that there was a true Aladdin and Jafar going on, and I&#8217;ll acknowledge that that might be true. Tell me that you know who was who, and in most cases I&#8217;ll shake my head.</p>
<p>Which brings me to me. Blogging about history is asking for trouble. Portray nearly any story or person as an Aladdin or a Jafar and you&#8217;ll feel the wrath of both the people who believe the opposite situation and the people who think you&#8217;ve oversimplified the situation. Portray something in a nuanced and balanced way and you&#8217;ll get yelled at by people who believe <em>both</em> of the one-sided views. Nothing brings people&#8217;s tribal fires to the table like history. I&#8217;ve learned this <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/09/muhammad-isis-iraqs-full-story.html" target="_blank">from</a> <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/absurdly-famous-people-probably-dont-know-enough.html" target="_blank">experience</a>.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t make me any less excited to write about history—but it makes me want to research the shit out of a part of history before I write about it. Only by reading a bunch of varying accounts and opinions can you start to form a clear picture of what we know and don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s why for this post, I&#8217;m not gonna tell you shit. Rather than dive into the weeds of what happened when, and why, I&#8217;m going to focus on one of the rare elements of history that&#8217;s indisputably black-and-white—<em>who </em>happened when.</p>
<p>Because before we can responsibly start arguing with each other about Aladdins and Jafars, we need to get the basic timeline and characters of the story clear.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m going to lay things out a little differently than you&#8217;re probably used to.</p>
<p>Normally, we learn about history&#8217;s storylines in isolation. We might have a strong sense of the history of physics breakthroughs or the progression of western philosophical thought or the succession of French rulers—but we&#8217;re not as clear on how each of these storylines relate to each <em>other</em>. If you think of history like a tangle of vines growing upwards through time, studying one type of history at a time is like following the path of one particular vine while ignoring the other vines around it. It&#8217;s understanding history in a <em>vertical </em>sense.</p>
<p>And while vertical history has its merits, it doesn&#8217;t leave you with an especially <em>complete</em> picture of any one time. An econ buff in the year 2500 might know all about the Great Depression that happened in the early 20th century and the major recession that happened about 80 years later, but that same person might mistake the two world wars for happening in the 1800s or the 2200s if they&#8217;re a little hazy on the history of wars. So while an econ buff, that person would have a pretty poor understanding of what our modern times are all <em>about. </em></p>
<p>Likewise, I might know that Copernicus began writing his seminal work <i>On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres </i>in Poland in the early 1510s, but by learning that right around that same time in Italy, Michelangelo painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, I get a better picture of the <em>times</em>. By learning that it was right while both of these things were happening that Henry VIII married Catherine of Aragon in England, the 1510s suddenly begins to take on a distinct <em>personality</em>. These three facts, when put together, allow me to see a more three-dimensional picture of the 1510s—it allows me to see the 1510s <em>horizontally</em>, like cutting out a complete segment of the vine tangle and examining it all together.</p>
<p>A blog post is limited in its ability to examine all of history horizontally. But I&#8217;ve taken two separate cracks below that I think can work together nicely to help us take a horizontal view of different times. Both involve a lot of names.</p>
<p>Which leads me to the inevitable disclaimer about <em>who </em>I chose to include. I tried to remove my own biases by gathering the names from a handful of lists by publications like <em>Time</em>. I searched the internet for things like &#8220;most influential people in history&#8221; and &#8220;most important people in the Middle Ages&#8221; and &#8220;most famous people of the 19th century&#8221; and &#8220;most powerful Chinese emperors&#8221; and ended up with a big pile of names, some of whom I&#8217;m familiar with, others I&#8217;m not. That said, between the fact that the lists I used were by publications targeting English-speaking people and that I inevitably leaned more towards people I had heard of, the group of names will skew America- and Euro-centric, with places like Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia probably underrepresented. This isn&#8217;t entirely by accident, though—this post is only useful if you&#8217;ve heard of the people, and I intentionally chose names I thought a large portion of Wait But Why readers would know. In other words, merit wasn&#8217;t the only criteria—household fame mattered too. And yes, I missed a lot of people—with limited space on the screen, the names had to be a sampling, not an exhaustive list.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Horizontal History—First Crack:</strong></span></p>
<p>For my first crack, I present to you a big pile of famous names, organized by birth decade—kind of a &#8220;2,600 Under 2,600&#8221; list. The purpose is to help orient ourselves on when people lived, especially <em>in relation to each other</em>.</p>
<p>Having a clear picture of generations is very easy when you think about currently-living people. For example, I know that Mark Zuckerberg is around my age while Vladimir Putin is about the age of my parents and George H.W. Bush is about the age of my grandparents. On the other side of things, Prince George—the one world-famous baby—is the age of my kids if I had kids. I know this without having to think about it:</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-4675"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4675" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations.png" alt="My generations" width="460" height="192" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations.png 1542w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-300x125.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-768x320.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-600x250.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></a></p>
<p>If I list people by birth decade instead of generation, it still makes sense. People born in the 70s and 60s feel older than me but not as old as my parents, and people born in the 30s and 40s feel older than my parents but younger than my grandparents:</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-decades.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-4674"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4674" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-decades.png" alt="My generations - decades" width="485" height="290" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-decades.png 1596w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-decades-300x179.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-decades-768x459.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-decades-600x359.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" /></a></p>
<p>But this is much harder for generations that aren&#8217;t currently alive, and it gets less and less clear the farther back you go. Quick! Name the oldest member and youngest member of this group: Nietzsche, Darwin, Freud, Marx, Gandhi, Tolstoy, Twain. Not that easy, right? And that&#8217;s only going back 200 years. But by laying them out by birth decade, you can get oriented:</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Older-decades.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-4642"><img class="wp-image-4642 aligncenter" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Older-decades.png" alt="Older decades" width="231" height="228" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Older-decades.png 418w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Older-decades-300x296.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" /></a></p>
<p>Since a generation is typically about 30 years, you can move three or six lines down from a name to see who they viewed as their parents&#8217; or grandparents&#8217; ages during their lifetimes, and you can go the same distance up to see who they viewed as their kids&#8217; or grandkids&#8217; age. So Darwin would have seen Twain as some young kid and he would have shaken his old man fist at Gandhi from the rocking chair on his porch. Meanwhile, Nietzsche would have seen Marx as a guy his dad&#8217;s age and Freud as a contemporary, though a bit younger.</p>
<p>Two people more than seven or eight lines away from each other on the list probably were not ever alive at the same time, which means they were likely not that clear about each others&#8217; generation, in the way I&#8217;m not really clear on whether Hemingway was in my great-grandparents&#8217; generation, my great-great-grandparents&#8217; generation, or some other age.</p>
<p>Using this decade list tool, let&#8217;s look at a whole group of famous historical figures to see who was the same age as whom, who shook their old man fist at whom, and who was and wasn&#8217;t alive at the same time. The decade colors are in a three-way cycle, so you can jump to rows of the same color above and below to quickly go up and down by generations (i.e. if you take a name on a green line, one green line down is their parents&#8217; age, three green lines up is their great-grandchildren&#8217;s age, etc.). For people alive today and in the past century, I couldn&#8217;t come close to including every famous person, so I just picked a sampling.</p>

<p>Okay how did that go? Fun? Icky? I can&#8217;t quite tell. In any case, let&#8217;s move on.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Horizontal History—Second Crack:</strong></span></p>
<p>For my second crack at depicting history horizontally, I present to you A Psychotic Jumble of Colorful Vertical Bars That Might Be Awesome or Maybe Not I Can&#8217;t Tell Here Either But I Think It Might Be Fun.</p>
<p>This time, I got more specific than birth decade and actually identified the exact birth year <em>and </em>the death year of each name, using a bar to depict their lifespan. While the above chart simplifies who lived when, the diagram below allows you to follow a single horizontal path along any year and see who was and wasn&#8217;t alive at that time.</p>
<p>As I made the diagram, I ran into a big problem, which is that it looked like an upside-down L with <em>way </em>more names at the top than the bottom (because there are a lot more household names who were alive in the last 200 years than in previous centuries). Crunching all those recent names into blog width made the font tiny—so I solved the problem by cutting out about half of the recent names. <em>But</em>, before I did, I broke the complete list of 1800–2016 names into two groups by category and here they are below:</p>

<p>Okay now that that&#8217;s out of the way, here&#8217;s the big list (with only half of the total 1800–2016 names included). It goes back to 1450. Trace a horizontal line across to get a feel for what was going on during that particular time.</p>

[<strong>Note: </strong>A number of people have requested a sideways version of this diagram. <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Sideways.jpg" target="_blank">Here it is.</a>]
<p>Some overall thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lifespans are unfair.</strong> Looking at people&#8217;s lives visually really makes it clear when two people are born around the same time but then one of them randomly dies 30 years before the other.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Murder is dickish.</strong> Another thing this diagram highlights. How not okay is it to cut someone <em>else&#8217;s </em>bar short? JFK might have been on his way to a nice 85-year bar when this other guy just took a scissors and <em>snipped </em>his bar.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>On the other hand, short lives were appreciated during the making of this diagram. </b>This was a nightmare of a puzzle, especially at the top, and while trying to fit a lot of bars into a small space, there were times I found myself saying, out loud, &#8220;Oh nice,&#8221; when I&#8217;d look up someone&#8217;s life dates and realize that they were murdered at a young age. Likewise, one factor that led to a number of the recent people being cut from the big diagram was living too long. Frank Lloyd Wright&#8217;s a cool dude, but not 2.5 inches of diagram cool.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Some people aren&#8217;t easily categorized<em>. </em></strong>I tried my best. You try putting Ben Franklin into a category.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yeah, yeah, I said the whole &#8220;Aladdin and Jafar are in the eye of the beholder&#8221; thing and then I created a category for people who I deemed dicks.<em> </em></strong>I know. But it was fun to label certain people as dicks. Ya know?</li>
</ul>
<p>Each little part of this diagram tells a story. Let&#8217;s go through a few examples:</p>
<p>I mentioned in a box in the first chart that Mozart wrote his <em>Requiem</em> the same year the US forefathers were writing the Bill of Rights and that Beethoven had a love-hate relationship with Napoleon—but using the lifespan diagram, you can see both of these stories visually.</p>

<p>I also mentioned the major Shakespeare, Galileo, Tokugawa, and John Smith events that all happened right around the year 1610.</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1610.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-4686"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4686" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1610.png" alt="1610" width="150" height="329" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1610.png 442w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1610-137x300.png 137w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1610-274x600.png 274w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>
<p>And in the intro, I referenced Copernicus&#8217;s seminal work happening right when Michelangelo was painting the Sistine Chapel ceiling and Henry VIII was marrying Catherine of Aragon.</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1510.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-4685"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4685" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1510.png" alt="1510" width="140" height="323" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1510.png 383w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1510-130x300.png 130w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1510-260x600.png 260w" sizes="(max-width: 140px) 100vw, 140px" /></a></p>
<p>But if you look at the other stuff the diagram shows going on around that same time, it tells a bigger story:</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Renaissance-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-4680"><img class="wp-image-4680 aligncenter" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Renaissance-2.jpg" alt="Renaissance" width="479" height="377" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Renaissance-2.jpg 1494w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Renaissance-2-300x236.jpg 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Renaissance-2-768x604.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Renaissance-2-600x472.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px" /></a></p>
<p>While Copernicus, Michelangelo, and Henry VIII were happening, it was also the golden age of European exploration—look at all those light purple explorers!—and the precursor age to the oncoming Age of Imperialism. Simultaneously, you can see the Protestant Reformation brewing with the presence of all those dark blue religious figures. The one dark blue exception is Guru Nanak, who was over in Asia being the founding prophet of Sikhism (today&#8217;s 5th biggest religion). Meanwhile, Michelangelo was part of something larger, as the other pink bars—and Machiavelli—remind us that the Italian Renaissance was in full swing.</p>
<p>Every time I look at the lifespan diagram, a new interesting horizontal pops out to me. Here&#8217;s one more: People in the US associate the 1860s with Lincoln and the Civil War. But what we overlook is that the 1860s was one of history&#8217;s greatest literary decades. In the ten years between 1859 and 1869, Darwin published his world-changing <em>On the Origin of Species </em>(1859), Dickens published <em>A Tale of Two Cities </em>(1859) and <em>Great Expectations </em>(1861), Lewis Carroll published <em>Alice in Wonderland </em>(1865), Dostoyevsky published <em>Crime and Punishment</em> (1866), and Tolstoy capped things off with <em>War and Peace</em> (1869). These guys were all in their primes <em>at the same time</em>. So was Lincoln, before some cock snipped his bar off at the worst time possible.</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1860s-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-4666"><img class="wp-image-4666 aligncenter" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1860s-2.jpg" alt="1860s" width="192" height="327" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1860s-2.jpg 573w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1860s-2-176x300.jpg 176w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1860s-2-353x600.jpg 353w" sizes="(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px" /></a></p>
<p>So there&#8217;s some horizontal history for you. Now go brush up so we can all be oriented the next time we yell at each other about fairy tales.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html" target="_blank">In a post last year</a>, we laid out the human lifespan visually. By years:</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Years.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-4593 aligncenter" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Years.jpg" alt="Years" width="329" height="345" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Years.jpg 329w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Years-286x300.jpg 286w" sizes="(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px" /></a></p>
<p>By months:</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Months.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-4591 aligncenter" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Months.jpg" alt="Months" width="585" height="554" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Months.jpg 1152w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Months-300x284.jpg 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Months-600x568.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px" /></a></p>
<p>And by weeks:</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Weeks.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-4592 aligncenter" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Weeks.jpg" alt="Weeks" width="640" height="1012" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Weeks.jpg 1204w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Weeks-190x300.jpg 190w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Weeks-379x600.jpg 379w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>While working on that post, I also made a days chart, but it seemed a bit much, so I left it out. But fuck it.</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Days-large-e1449796562773.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4588" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Days.jpg" alt="Days" width="900" height="1051" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Days.jpg 2000w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Days-257x300.jpg 257w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Days-514x600.jpg 514w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>The days chart blows my mind as much as the weeks chart. Each of those dots is only a single Tuesday or Friday or Sunday, but even a lucky person who lives to 90 will have no problem fitting every day in their life on <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/A-90-Year-Life-in-Days.pdf" target="_blank">one sheet of paper</a>.</p>
<p>But since doing the Life in Weeks post, I&#8217;ve been thinking about something else.</p>
<p>Instead of measuring your life in units of time, you can measure it in activities or events. To use myself as an example:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m 34, so let&#8217;s be super optimistic and say I&#8217;ll be hanging around drawing stick figures till I&#8217;m 90.<a href="#footnote-1-4579" id="note-1-4579" rel="footnote">1</a> If so, I have a little under 60 winters left:</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Winters.png" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-4587 aligncenter" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Winters.png" alt="Winters" width="345" height="343" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Winters.png 645w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Winters-150x150.png 150w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Winters-600x598.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px" /></a></p>
<p>And maybe around 60 Superbowls left:</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Superbowls.png" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-4586 aligncenter" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Superbowls.png" alt="Superbowls" width="383" height="360" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Superbowls.png 1000w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Superbowls-300x282.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Superbowls-600x563.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /></a></p>
<p>The ocean is freezing and putting my body into it is a bad life experience, so I tend to limit myself to around one ocean swim a year. So as weird as it seems, I might only go in the ocean 60 more times:</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ocean.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4582" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ocean.png" alt="Ocean" width="400" height="291" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ocean.png 1288w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ocean-300x218.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ocean-600x436.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>Not counting Wait But Why research, I read about five books a year, so even though it feels like I&#8217;ll read an endless number of books in the future, I actually have to choose only 300 of all the books out there to read and accept that I&#8217;ll sign off for eternity without knowing what goes on in all the rest.</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/books.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4580" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/books.png" alt="books" width="524" height="540" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/books.png 1741w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/books-291x300.png 291w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/books-582x600.png 582w" sizes="(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px" /></a></p>
<p>Growing up in Boston, I went to Red Sox games all the time, but if I never move back there, I&#8217;ll probably continue at my current rate of going to a Sox game about once every three years—meaning this little row of 20 represents my remaining Fenway visits:</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sox.png" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-4585 aligncenter" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sox.png" alt="sox" width="693" height="61" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sox.png 1893w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sox-300x26.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sox-600x53.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px" /></a></p>
<p>There have been eight US presidential elections during my lifetime and about 15 to go. I&#8217;ve seen five presidents in office and if that rate continues, I&#8217;ll see about nine more.</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/presidents.png" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-4584 aligncenter" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/presidents.png" alt="presidents" width="540" height="68" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/presidents.png 1610w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/presidents-300x38.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/presidents-600x76.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>I probably eat pizza about once a month, so I&#8217;ve got about 700 more chances to eat pizza. I have an even brighter future with dumplings. I have Chinese food about twice a month and I tend to make sure six dumplings occurs each time, so I have a fuckton of dumplings to look forward to:</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dumplings-small.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4581" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dumplings-small.png" alt="dumplings small" width="721" height="1970" /></a></p>
<p>But these things aren&#8217;t what I&#8217;ve been thinking about. Most of the things I just mentioned happen with a similar frequency during each year of my life, which spreads them out somewhat evenly through time. If I&#8217;m around a third of my way through life, I&#8217;m also about a third of my way through experiencing the activity or event.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;ve been thinking about is a really important part of life that, unlike all of these examples, isn&#8217;t spread out evenly through time—something whose [already done / still to come] ratio doesn&#8217;t at all align with how far I am through life:</p>
<p>Relationships.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about my parents, who are in their mid-60s. During my first 18 years, I spent some time with my parents during at least 90% of my days. But since heading off to college and then later moving out of Boston, I&#8217;ve probably seen them an average of only five times a year each, for an average of maybe two days each time. 10 days a year. About 3% of the days I spent with them each year of my childhood.</p>
<p>Being in their mid-60s, let&#8217;s continue to be super optimistic and say I&#8217;m one of the incredibly lucky people to have both parents alive into my 60s. That would give us about 30 more years of coexistence. If the ten days a year thing holds, that&#8217;s 300 days left to hang with mom and dad. Less time than I spent with them in any one of my 18 childhood years.</p>
<p>When you look at that reality, you realize that despite not being at the end of your life, you may very well be nearing the end of your time with some of the most important people in your life. If I lay out the total days I&#8217;ll ever spend with each of my parents—assuming I&#8217;m as lucky as can be—this becomes starkly clear:</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/parents-small.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4583" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/parents-small.png" alt="parents small" width="800" height="2071" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/parents-small.png 3200w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/parents-small-116x300.png 116w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/parents-small-232x600.png 232w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>It turns out that when I graduated from high school, I had already used up 93% of my in-person parent time. I&#8217;m now enjoying the last 5% of that time. We&#8217;re in the tail end.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a similar story with my two sisters. After living in a house with them for 10 and 13 years respectively, I now live across the country from both of them and spend maybe 15 days with each of them a year. Hopefully, that leaves us with about 15% of our total hangout time left.</p>
<p>The same often goes for old friends. In high school, I sat around playing hearts with the same four guys about five days a week. In four years, we probably racked up 700 group hangouts. Now, scattered around the country with totally different lives and schedules, the five of us are in the same room at the same time probably 10 days each decade. The group is in its final 7%.</p>
<p>So what do we do with this information?</p>
<p>Setting aside my secret hope that technological advances will let me live to 700, I see three takeaways here:</p>
<p><strong>1) Living in the same place as the people you love matters. </strong>I probably have 10X the time left with the people who live in my city as I do with the people who live somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>2) Priorities matter. </strong>Your remaining face time with any person depends largely on where that person falls on your list of life priorities. Make sure this list is set by you—not by unconscious inertia.</p>
<p><strong>3) Quality time matters. </strong>If you&#8217;re in your last 10% of time with someone you love, keep that fact in the front of your mind when you&#8217;re with them and treat that time as what it actually is: precious.</p>
